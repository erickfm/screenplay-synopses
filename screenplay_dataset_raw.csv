He takes Sarah's arm,\n\n     stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.\n\n     \n\n                          BURNHAM\n\n               You seem like a good kid.

Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's\n\n     arm, pulls it tight.\n\n     \n\n                          BURNHAM\n\n               Hey, nod or something, show me\n\n               you're still alive, will ya?\n\n     \n\n     Sarah nods.\n\n     \n\n                          BURNHAM\n\n               Attagirl.

While Burnham goes through the process of\n\n     finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he\n\n     goes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:\n\n     \n\n                          BURNHAM\n\n               Yeah, you don't think about that\n\n               stuff.

You're just in time.\n\n\n\nJudas is startled.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     God purified me tonight. I thought \n\n     it was so I could go out and preach. \n\n     But now I see. It's so I could die. \n\n     And you're God's instrument. He \n\n     brought us together.\n\n\n\nJesus opens his tunic.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Here's my neck. Cut it. Come on, cut \n\n     it. What's the matter? Is there \n\n     anything wrong? I was purified, you \n\n     got your permission, it's all arranged \n\n     by God. So what are you waiting for?\n\n\n\nThey stare at each other.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     You can't do it, can you?\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     I can if I want.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Why don't you want?\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     I do want.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Fine.\n\n\n\nHe positions himself for killing again. There is another \n\npause.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Did you work some magic on me? When \n\n     I go to kill a man, I kill him.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n          (thinking it out)\n\n     Maybe God doesn't want me to die. If \n\n     God really wanted me to die, you \n\n     wouldn't hesitate. You'd just kill \n\n     me.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     No, you should die. What good are \n\n     you living? Why should God want you \n\n     alive? What good are you for Israel? \n\n     Do you have some secret?\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     I have no secret. I know that I have \n\n     pity, though.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Pity! How far will that get us? What \n\n     good is that for Israel?\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     It's good for men.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Men! The Greeks who killed us were \n\n     men. So are the Romans. Don't pity \n\n     men, pity Israel. The rest can go to \n\n     hell.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     I feel pity for everything. Donkeys, \n\n     sparrows, grass.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     And ants? I suppose you feel pity \n\n     for them too?\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Yes. Everything's a part of God. \n\n     When I look into the ant, into his \n\n     shiny black eye, I see the face of \n\n     God.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     What do you see when you look in my \n\n     face?\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n          (matter of factly)\n\n     I see God too.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     You see God everywhere, don't you? \n\n     Maybe that's why you don't fear death.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Why should I fear death? Death isn't \n\n     a door that closes, it's a door that \n\n     opens. It opens and you enter.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n          (pause)\n\n     If I don't kill you, what happens?\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     I don't know.

I told you. You're not crazy at \n\n     all, are you? If God does talk through \n\n     you, then you're the messenger of \n\n     God and I can't kill a messenger of \n\n     God, can I? You've got my hand \n\n     stopped.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     I didn't stop your hand, God did.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     He's the only one who could.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     God didn't send you to kill me.

Why?\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Because he was the living proof of \n\n     your power. Zealots say you're paid \n\n     by the Romans to tell the people \n\n     only heaven is important. Not their \n\n     life now. Not being dominated by \n\n     Romans. That's very dangerous.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n          (quietly)\n\n     Yes. It make everything clearer.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Clearer? What are you talking about, \n\n     clearer? It just makes everything \n\n     worse.

He was afflicted, \n\n     yet he opened not his mouth.

What does that have to do with \n\n     you?\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Judas. I'm the lamb. I'm the one who \n\n     is going to die.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     What do you mean, die? Die? Did you \n\n     change your mind again.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     No.\n\n\n\nJudas jumps up.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Then what are you talking about? \n\n     That can't be.

By \n\n     footsteps. By voices. By headaches. \n\n     By shadows. And you know what the \n\n     shadow is? It's the cross. I have to \n\n     die on the cross.

He wasn\'t the son of Mary, \n\n     he was the son of God. His mother \n\n     was a virgin. The angel Gabriel came \n\n     to earth and put God\'s seed in her \n\n     womb. That\'s how he was born. He \n\n     took on our sins, he was tortured, \n\n     crucified -- but three days later he \n\n     rose again and was taken up to heaven. \n\n     Death was conquered, praise God! \n\n     Death was conquered, sins were \n\n     forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven\'s \n\n     now open to everyone.\n\n\n\nJesus can restrain himself no longer.

But when \n\n     death got too close you ran away, \n\n     you got scared and ran away and hid \n\n     yourself in the life of some... man. \n\n     We did what we were supposed to do. \n\n     You didn\'t.

Rabbi, you broke my heart. \n\n     Sometimes I curse the day I ever met \n\n     you. We held the world in our hands. \n\n     Remember what you said to me? You \n\n     took me in your arms, do you remember? \n\n     And you begged me. ""Betray me, betray \n\n     me. I have to be crucified. I have \n\n     to be resurrected to save the world.""\n\n\n\nThe wounds in Jesus\' hands and feet begin to bleed.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n          (continuing)\n\n     ""I am the lamb,"" you said. ""Death is \n\n     the door. Judas, my brother, don\'t \n\n     be afraid. Help me go through the \n\n     door."" And I loved you so much I \n\n     went and betrayed you. But you... \n\n     you... what are you doing here? What \n\n     business do you have here? With women, \n\n     with children... what\'s good for a \n\n     man isn\'t good enough for God. Why \n\n     weren\'t you crucified?\n\n\n\nJudas is crying.\n\n\n\n          PETER\n\n     Look at his wounds, Judas. He\'s \n\n     bleeding. You\'re hurting him, that\'s \n\n     enough.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     He was going to be the New Covenant. \n\n     Now there\'s no more Israel.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     But my Guardian Angel...\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Your Guradian Angel!

If you die like that, you deny \n\n     God. Your Father. Then there\'s no \n\n     sacrifice. Then there\'s no salvation.\n\n\n\nJesus looks over at Mary and Martha, then back at the \n\ndisciples. They have disappeared.\n\n\n\nHe looks again, and for the last time, at Mary and Martha. \n\nNow they are gone too.\n\n\n\nHe is left alone in the room with the death figure.\n\n\n\n          DEATH FIGURE\n\n     I told you we would meet again.\n\n\n\nJesus starts to try to pull himself up off the floor.

The receptionist \n\n               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on \n\n               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their \n\n               fingers somehow.

We see that Juno\'s chair is EMPTY.\n\n\n\n               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door \n\n               drift shut. Juno\'s figure recedes into the distance as she \n\n               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.'

But Sam is looking away from the Harvester,\n\n     focussed on the Girl.\n\n\n\n     ON SAM: He doesn't notice Matthew (The Harvester) suddenly\n\n     veer RIGHT, slamming into the side of the Rover and causing\n\n     Sam to lose control.\n\n\n\n     The steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately\n\n     tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle, but a split\n\n     second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox, and SPUN\n\n     into the path of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS SCREECH of\n\n     MANGLED METAL -- the Rover gobbled up by the front of the\n\n     Harvester, DEVOURED.\n\n\n\n     The Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester's monstrous AXLE,\n\n     resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG,\n\n     BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL.\n\n\n\n     WIDE SHOT: Silence.

It soon becomes\n\n     apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of\n\n     the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what\n\n     that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.\n\n\n\n     Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with\n\n     CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens\n\n     the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.\n\n\n\n     ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam\n\n     takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the\n\n     Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep\n\n     FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.\n\n\n\n                                                                       36.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER\n\n\n\n     The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the\n\n     accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles\n\n     of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is\n\n     an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped\n\n     inside.\n\n\n\n     Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his\n\n     body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching\n\n     for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.\n\n\n\n     With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door\n\n     open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --\n\n     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.\n\n\n\n     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,\n\n     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam\n\n     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and\n\n     turns the unconscious man onto his back.\n\n\n\n     He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans\n\n     down even closer.\n\n\n\n\n\n     CLOSE UP -- THE MAN\n\n\n\n     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as\n\n     we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of\n\n     the film.\n\n\n\n     Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the\n\n     REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has\n\n     just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n     WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER\n\n\n\n     Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious\n\n     Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him\n\n     to the parked Rover.\n\n\n\n                                                     CUT TO:""

They\'re still facing each other\n\n     across the sixty foot drop.\n\n\n\n     MELTON glances down...without losing sight of TODD.\n\n\n\n     ROMERO and GOINES are coming up the chains fast, hand over hand. \n\n     They\'re within ten feet, their impassive faces look dangerous.\n\n\n\n     Nothing shows on MELTON\'s machine-face, but he starts a slight\n\n     motion in his chain so that he spins slowly.  That way, as the \n\n     veterans surround him, he keeps a continual eye an all three.\n\n\n\n     TODD, his face impassive, eyes MELTON vigilantly.\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON RUBRICK BELOW\n\n\n\n     For a long moment, RUBRICK looks up at the three men dangling\n\n     around the new soldier, then he shouts loudly at them.\n\n                                   RUBRICK\n\n                    Get him, men!\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD as SMASH!  TODD is hit hard in the face even as he\n\n     starts to swing.  WHAM!  MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his\n\n     grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches,\n\n     slides...\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, hit as he swings at MELTON.  WHAM!\n\n     MELTON hits him again, hard.\n\n\n\n     GOINES swings against MELTON from behind, smashing at him with\n\n     his free hand and with both feet.\n\n\n\n     MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the\n\n     face with one hand, yanks the face close to his own, and squeezes \n\n     mercilessly.\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, TWENTY FEET BELOW.  He\'s managed to get a foothold\n\n     on one of the mini-platforms.  His face horribly bloody, he looks\n\n     up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly\n\n     hurl ROMERO downward.\n\n\n\n     ROMERO rockets down past TODD...\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH!  ROMERO\'s body crunches against the \n\n     cement not far from RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH, splattering them\n\n     with blood.\n\n\n\n     Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up\n\n     again...\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who\'s\n\n     been clubbing him from behind...GOINES!\n\n     GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON, eyes merciless, deadly, \n\n     swings after him.\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD, bloody, struggling up the chain hand over hand.\n\n     His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and\n\n     swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES.\n\n\n\n     Just then, GOINES lunges at MELTON, SMACK, SMASH, he hits him\n\n     hard, and WHAM!  MELTON hits him back...\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a ""platform"" foothold on his\n\n     chain five feet above the swinging fighters.  TODD looks down\n\n     on MELTON\'s back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing,\n\n     then...\n\n\n\n     TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON\'s back, crooking one\n\n     arm around the new soldier\'s neck and pounding him with one free\n\n     hand and strangling him with the other arm.\n\n\n\n     MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face.\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW.  For the first time a frown of\n\n     concern wrinkles his brow.\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders.\n\n     MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD\'s ribs hard and TODD gasps\n\n     for air, but...\n\n\n\n     GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON\'s balls and...\n\n\n\n     MELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips\n\n     him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward\n\n     even as...\n\n\n\n     TODD goes for face with his free hand.\n\n\n\n     SLAM!  MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow.\n\n\n\n     TODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON\'s eyes.\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of\n\n     MELTON\'s injury.\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank\n\n     impassive faces, RILEY among them.\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like.\n\n\n\n     ANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD.  SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  MELTON\'s\n\n     elbows drive back into TODD\'s ribs.

He wasn\'t the son of Mary, \n\n     he was the son of God. His mother \n\n     was a virgin. The angel Gabriel came \n\n     to earth and put God\'s seed in her \n\n     womb. That\'s how he was born. He \n\n     took on our sins, he was tortured, \n\n     crucified -- but three days later he \n\n     rose again and was taken up to heaven. \n\n     Death was conquered, praise God! \n\n     Death was conquered, sins were \n\n     forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven\'s \n\n     now open to everyone.\n\n\n\nJesus can restrain himself no longer.

 'INT. MARY AND MARTHA\'S - NIGHT\n\n\n\nJesus lies dying. He is facing the entrance, in which we can \n\nsee glimmers of the still-burning sky.\n\n\n\nMary and Martha stand close around him. Jesus is in no pain. \n\nHe seems to be at peace.\n\n\n\nSuddenly looming in the entranceway, silhouetted against the \n\nred sky, is the figure of an old man. He starts down the few \n\nstone steps into the room where Jesus lies. He is followed \n\nby two other men. The Guardian Angel recognizes them instantly \n\nand starts toward them.\n\n\n\n          PETER\n\n     Let us through. We\'re sent by God.\n\n          (to Jesus)\n\n     He told us you would show yourself \n\n     to us. He said you were dying.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Is that Peter? I can\'t tell.

But when \n\n     death got too close you ran away, \n\n     you got scared and ran away and hid \n\n     yourself in the life of some... man. \n\n     We did what we were supposed to do. \n\n     You didn\'t. You\'re a coward.\n\n\n\n          PETER\n\n     Don\'t you have any respect.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     For him? He was supposed to save \n\n     man.

Rabbi, you broke my heart. \n\n     Sometimes I curse the day I ever met \n\n     you. We held the world in our hands. \n\n     Remember what you said to me? You \n\n     took me in your arms, do you remember? \n\n     And you begged me. ""Betray me, betray \n\n     me. I have to be crucified.

Why \n\n     weren\'t you crucified?\n\n\n\nJudas is crying.\n\n\n\n          PETER\n\n     Look at his wounds, Judas. He\'s \n\n     bleeding. You\'re hurting him, that\'s \n\n     enough.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     He was going to be the New Covenant. \n\n     Now there\'s no more Israel.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     But my Guardian Angel...\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Your Guradian Angel!

If you die like that, you deny \n\n     God. Your Father. Then there\'s no \n\n     sacrifice. Then there\'s no salvation.\n\n\n\nJesus looks over at Mary and Martha, then back at the \n\ndisciples. They have disappeared.\n\n\n\nHe looks again, and for the last time, at Mary and Martha. \n\nNow they are gone too.\n\n\n\nHe is left alone in the room with the death figure.\n\n\n\n          DEATH FIGURE\n\n     I told you we would meet again.\n\n\n\nJesus starts to try to pull himself up off the floor.

He CRUSHES the accelerator\n\n     peddle.\n\n\n\n     For a moment Sam drives right alongside the Harvester,\n\n     clouds of lunar dust being kicked up, cascading against the\n\n     side window. But Sam is looking away from the Harvester,\n\n     focussed on the Girl.\n\n\n\n     ON SAM: He doesn't notice Matthew (The Harvester) suddenly\n\n     veer RIGHT, slamming into the side of the Rover and causing\n\n     Sam to lose control.\n\n\n\n     The steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately\n\n     tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle, but a split\n\n     second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox, and SPUN\n\n     into the path of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS SCREECH of\n\n     MANGLED METAL -- the Rover gobbled up by the front of the\n\n     Harvester, DEVOURED.\n\n\n\n     The Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester's monstrous AXLE,\n\n     resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG,\n\n     BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL.\n\n\n\n     WIDE SHOT: Silence.

 ""77   EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                       77\n\n\n\n     Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes\n\n     apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of\n\n     the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what\n\n     that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.\n\n\n\n     Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with\n\n     CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens\n\n     the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.\n\n\n\n     ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam\n\n     takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the\n\n     Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep\n\n     FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.\n\n\n\n                                                                       36.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER\n\n\n\n     The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the\n\n     accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles\n\n     of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is\n\n     an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped\n\n     inside.\n\n\n\n     Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his\n\n     body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching\n\n     for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.\n\n\n\n     With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door\n\n     open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --\n\n     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.\n\n\n\n     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,\n\n     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam\n\n     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and\n\n     turns the unconscious man onto his back.\n\n\n\n     He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans\n\n     down even closer.\n\n\n\n\n\n     CLOSE UP -- THE MAN\n\n\n\n     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as\n\n     we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of\n\n     the film.\n\n\n\n     Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the\n\n     REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has\n\n     just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n     WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER\n\n\n\n     Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious\n\n     Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him\n\n     to the parked Rover.\n\n\n\n                                                     CUT TO:""

The magazine selection is lots of \n\n               ""mommy mags"" and health related periodicals.

The girl bites her \n\n               thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.\n\n\n\n               Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting \n\n               woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. \n\n               Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist \n\n               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on \n\n               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their \n\n               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...\n\n\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n\n\n                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST\n\n                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?\n\n\n\n               There\'s no answer. We see that Juno\'s chair is EMPTY.\n\n\n\n               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door \n\n               drift shut. Juno\'s figure recedes into the distance as she \n\n               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.'

CEMENT FACTORY - MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT   52                    75\n\n\n\n    ON TV:  Hauser reaches into the same satchel that Quaid picked\n\n    up at the pawn shop.\n\n\n\n                        HAUSER\n\n              First, let\'s get rid of that bug in\n\n              your head.\n\n                   (holds up plastic bag)\n\n              Take this thing out of the case and\n\n              stick it up your nose.  Don\'t worry;\n\n              it\'s self guiding.  Just shove real\n\n              hard...\n\n\n\n    Quaid throws the remainder of his Mars bar to the rats and\n\n    takes out ""the thingy in the plastic bag"".  He tears it open\n\n    and removes a surgical instrument that looks like the metallic\n\n    tentacle of an alien.\n\n\n\n                        HAUSER (CONT\'D)\n\n              When you hear the crunch, you\'re there.\n\n              Just pull it out.\n\n\n\n    He sticks the tentacle up his nose and shoves.  Whoa!  Quaid\n\n    grimaces with pain.\n\n\n\n                        HAUSER (CONT\'D)\n\n              And be careful.  It\'s my head, too.\n\n\n\n    The recorded message freeze-frames.  Quaid warily sits down\n\n    and continues with the procedure.\n\n\n\n    As the instrument winds through his sinuses, Quaid\'s face\n\n    bulges and distorts.  The pain grows more and more intense\n\n    until CRUNCH!  The instrument breaks through cartilage and\n\n    stops.\n\n\n\n    Quaid pulls the large device from his nose.  The homing device\n\n    glistens like an aluminum pea in a tiny claw at the end of\n\n    the tentacle.\n\n\n\n    Quaid takes the bloody pea, rolls it between his thumb and\n\n    forefinger, then shoves it into a Mars bar.'
 '98 INT. HILTON - QUAID\'S ROOM - DAY (LATE)  73                        98\n\n\n\n    Quaid lies forlorn on his bed in the dark, staring at the\n\n    TV, but not really watching.  The blue light of the television\n\n    flickers against the somber red of the setting sun.\n\n\n\n    ON TV:  COHAAGEN delivers a speech from his office.\n\n\n\n                        COHAAGEN\n\n              This afternoon at 4:30pm, I signed an\n\n              order declaring martial law throughout\n\n              the Mars Federal Colony.  I will not\n\n              tolerate any further damage to our\n\n              mineral export operations.  Mr. Kuato\n\n              and his terrorists must understand that\n\n              their self-defeating efforts will only\n\n              bring misery and suffering to the people\n\n              of Mars.\n\n\n\n    Quaid turns off the TV and stares at the ceiling.  He is\n\n    startled by a KNOCK AT THE DOOR.\n\n\n\n    Quaid sits up slowly, on alert.\n\n\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n\n                   (through door)\n\n              Mr. Quaid...?\n\n\n\n    Quaid picks up his gun.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              What?\n\n\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n\n              I need to talk to you--about Mr. Hauser.\n\n\n\n    Quaid COCKS his gun and approaches the door very cautiously,\n\n    from the side.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              Who are you?\n\n\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n\n              Dr. Edgemar.

I\'m not armed.\n\n\n\n    All of a sudden, Quaid flings opens the door and takes\n\n    hair-trigger aim at...Dr. Edgemar from the Rekall\n\n    commercial!!!  He\'s dresses in the same tweed jacket.  Quaid\n\n    keeps the gun on Edgemar and glances up and down the hall.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Don\'t worry; I\'m alone. --May I come\n\n              in?\n\n\n\n    Quaid roughly pulls Edgemar into the hotel room and closes\n\n    the door.  He frisks Edgemar and find to weapon.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              What do you want?\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              This is going to be very difficult for\n\n              you at accept, Mr. Quaid.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              I\'m listening.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              I\'m afraid you\'re not really standing\n\n              here right now.\n\n\n\n    Quaid can\'t repress a chuckle.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              Ya know, Doc, you could have folled\n\n              me.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              I\'m quite serious.

What you\'re experiencing\n\n              is a free-form delusion based on our\n\n              memory tapes.  But you\'re inventing\n\n              it yourself as you go along.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              Well, if this is my delusion, who\n\n              invited you?\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              I\'ve been artificially implanted as\n\n              an emergency measure.\n\n                   (gravely)\n\n              I\'m sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid,\n\n              but you\'ve suffered a schizoid embolism.\n\n              We can\'t snap you out of your fantasy.\n\n              I\'ve been sent in to try to talk you\n\n              down.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              How much is Cohaagen paying you for\n\n              this?\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Think about it.  Your dream started\n\n              in the middle of the implant procedure.\n\n              Everything after that--the chases, the\n\n              trip to Mars, your suite here at the\n\n              Hilton--these are all elements of your\n\n              Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid\n\n              to be a secret agent.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              Bullshit.  It\'s all coincidence.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              What about the girl?  Brunette,\n\n              athletic, sleazy and demure; just like\n\n              you specified.  Is that a coincidence?\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              She\'s real.  I dreamed about her before\n\n              I even went to Rekall.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself?\n\n              ""She\'s real because you dreamed her?""\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              That\'s right.\n\n\n\n    Edgemar sighs, discouraged.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Maybe this\'ll convince you.  Would you\n\n              mind opening the door?\n\n\n\n    Quaid jabs his gun into Edgemar\'s ribs.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              You open it.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              No need to be rude.  I\'ll do it.\n\n\n\n    Quaid shadows Edgemar as he opens the door.\n\n\n\n    Lori stands in the threshold!\n\n\n\n    Quaid does his best to absorb another shock.\n\n\n\n    Lori puts on a brave face, like holding back tears in front\n\n    of a sick child.  There is not the slightest indication that\n\n    she has even been anything but Quaid\'s adoring wife.\n\n\n\n                        LORI\n\n              Sweetheart...\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Come in, Mrs. Quaid.\n\n\n\n    Lori walks in hesitantly.

Abruptly, he swings his\n\n    gun at Edgemar and fires.\n\n\n\n    Edgemar\'s blood splatters in a dense circle on the wall.\n\n    Quaid spits the pill out onto Edgemar\'s blood-stained body.\n\n\n\n                        LORI\n\n              Now you\'ve done it!

FOUR MARS AGENTS storm through the big hole.\n\n\n\n    Quaid ducks, turns, and starts to rise, facing toward the\n\n    wall.\n\n\n\n    Agent #1 rushes Quaid.  Quaid ducks as Agent #1 goes to hit\n\n    Quaid with his gun, but goes over Quaid\'s shoulder.\n\n\n\n    Quaid rises and flips #1 over his right shoulder.  #1 lands on\n\n    bed.

Quaid then\n\n    elbows #2 in the chest then backhands #2 across the face.  #2\n\n    falls backwards.\n\n\n\n    Quaid then throws a right cross at #3, who falls backwards, as\n\n    Quaid follows through with his punch.  #4 comes in and kicks\n\n    Quaid in the stomach with his right foot.  Quaid reacts, then\n\n    backhands #4 across the face.  #4 hits the ground.\n\n\n\n    #2 comes in with a right leg kick at Quaid\'s left\n\n    shoulder/head.

It soon becomes\n\n     apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of\n\n     the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what\n\n     that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.\n\n\n\n     Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with\n\n     CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens\n\n     the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.\n\n\n\n     ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline.

Sam peers closer and sees that there is\n\n     an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped\n\n     inside.\n\n\n\n     Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his\n\n     body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching\n\n     for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.\n\n\n\n     With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door\n\n     open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --\n\n     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.\n\n\n\n     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,\n\n     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam\n\n     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and\n\n     turns the unconscious man onto his back.\n\n\n\n     He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans\n\n     down even closer.\n\n\n\n\n\n     CLOSE UP -- THE MAN\n\n\n\n     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM.

Quaid reacts, then\n\n    backhands #4 across the face.  #4 hits the ground.\n\n\n\n    #2 comes in with a right leg kick at Quaid\'s left\n\n    shoulder/head.  Quaid grabs the leg and throws him.\n\n    Instantly, #3 is rising up behind Quaid and hits him on the\n\n    back of the head with his gun.  Quaid collapses and tries to\n\n    crawl away towards the door.\n\n\n\n    #1 grabs Quaid by the collar and shirt.  #4 grabs his left\n\n    leg, and they try and restrain him.\n\n\n\n    Then Lori steps in and kicks across the face, moves around to\n\n    the other side and kicks him in the balls.

He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --\n\n     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.\n\n\n\n     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,\n\n     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil.

Why?\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Because he was the living proof of \n\n     your power. Zealots say you're paid \n\n     by the Romans to tell the people \n\n     only heaven is important. Not their \n\n     life now. Not being dominated by \n\n     Romans. That's very dangerous.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n          (quietly)\n\n     Yes. It make everything clearer.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Clearer? What are you talking about, \n\n     clearer? It just makes everything \n\n     worse. We want a revolution, the \n\n     Zealots want a revolution but now \n\n     they're against us. We can't let \n\n     that happen. We need them.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Do you want to join them, then?\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     No. They're my brothers, but you're \n\n     my master.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     You are the strongest, aren't you? \n\n     Of all my friends, you're the \n\n     strongest.

He was afflicted, \n\n     yet he opened not his mouth. Despised \n\n     and rejected by all, he went forward \n\n     without resisting, like a lamb led \n\n     to the slaughter.'\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n          (pause)\n\n     So? What does that have to do with \n\n     you?\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Judas. I'm the lamb. I'm the one who \n\n     is going to die.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     What do you mean, die? Die? Did you \n\n     change your mind again.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     No.\n\n\n\nJudas jumps up.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Then what are you talking about? \n\n     That can't be. If you're the Messiah, \n\n     why do you have to die?\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Don't shout. You'll understand soon. \n\n     At first I didn't understand myself.\n\n\n\n          JUDAS\n\n     Every day you have a different plan. \n\n     I can't believe it. First it's love, \n\n     then it's the ax, now you have to \n\n     die. What good could that do. We \n\n     need you alive.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     I can't help it.

By \n\n     footsteps. By voices. By headaches. \n\n     By shadows. And you know what the \n\n     shadow is? It's the cross. I have to \n\n     die on the cross.

That\'s how he was born. He \n\n     took on our sins, he was tortured, \n\n     crucified -- but three days later he \n\n     rose again and was taken up to heaven. \n\n     Death was conquered, praise God! \n\n     Death was conquered, sins were \n\n     forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven\'s \n\n     now open to everyone.\n\n\n\nJesus can restrain himself no longer.

CEMENT FACTORY - MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT   52                    75\n\n\n\n    ON TV:  Hauser reaches into the same satchel that Quaid picked\n\n    up at the pawn shop.\n\n\n\n                        HAUSER\n\n              First, let\'s get rid of that bug in\n\n              your head.\n\n                   (holds up plastic bag)\n\n              Take this thing out of the case and\n\n              stick it up your nose.  Don\'t worry;\n\n              it\'s self guiding.  Just shove real\n\n              hard...\n\n\n\n    Quaid throws the remainder of his Mars bar to the rats and\n\n    takes out ""the thingy in the plastic bag"".  He tears it open\n\n    and removes a surgical instrument that looks like the metallic\n\n    tentacle of an alien.\n\n\n\n                        HAUSER (CONT\'D)\n\n              When you hear the crunch, you\'re there.\n\n              Just pull it out.\n\n\n\n    He sticks the tentacle up his nose and shoves.  Whoa!  Quaid\n\n    grimaces with pain.\n\n\n\n                        HAUSER (CONT\'D)\n\n              And be careful.  It\'s my head, too.\n\n\n\n    The recorded message freeze-frames.  Quaid warily sits down\n\n    and continues with the procedure.\n\n\n\n    As the instrument winds through his sinuses, Quaid\'s face\n\n    bulges and distorts.  The pain grows more and more intense\n\n    until CRUNCH!  The instrument breaks through cartilage and\n\n    stops.\n\n\n\n    Quaid pulls the large device from his nose.  The homing device\n\n    glistens like an aluminum pea in a tiny claw at the end of\n\n    the tentacle.\n\n\n\n    Quaid takes the bloody pea, rolls it between his thumb and\n\n    forefinger, then shoves it into a Mars bar.'
 '98 INT. HILTON - QUAID\'S ROOM - DAY (LATE)  73                        98\n\n\n\n    Quaid lies forlorn on his bed in the dark, staring at the\n\n    TV, but not really watching.  The blue light of the television\n\n    flickers against the somber red of the setting sun.\n\n\n\n    ON TV:  COHAAGEN delivers a speech from his office.\n\n\n\n                        COHAAGEN\n\n              This afternoon at 4:30pm, I signed an\n\n              order declaring martial law throughout\n\n              the Mars Federal Colony.  I will not\n\n              tolerate any further damage to our\n\n              mineral export operations.  Mr. Kuato\n\n              and his terrorists must understand that\n\n              their self-defeating efforts will only\n\n              bring misery and suffering to the people\n\n              of Mars.\n\n\n\n    Quaid turns off the TV and stares at the ceiling.  He is\n\n    startled by a KNOCK AT THE DOOR.\n\n\n\n    Quaid sits up slowly, on alert.\n\n\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n\n                   (through door)\n\n              Mr. Quaid...?\n\n\n\n    Quaid picks up his gun.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              What?\n\n\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n\n              I need to talk to you--about Mr. Hauser.\n\n\n\n    Quaid COCKS his gun and approaches the door very cautiously,\n\n    from the side.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              Who are you?\n\n\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n\n              Dr. Edgemar.

I\'m not armed.\n\n\n\n    All of a sudden, Quaid flings opens the door and takes\n\n    hair-trigger aim at...Dr. Edgemar from the Rekall\n\n    commercial!!!  He\'s dresses in the same tweed jacket.  Quaid\n\n    keeps the gun on Edgemar and glances up and down the hall.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Don\'t worry; I\'m alone. --May I come\n\n              in?\n\n\n\n    Quaid roughly pulls Edgemar into the hotel room and closes\n\n    the door.  He frisks Edgemar and find to weapon.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              What do you want?\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              This is going to be very difficult for\n\n              you at accept, Mr. Quaid.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              I\'m listening.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              I\'m afraid you\'re not really standing\n\n              here right now.\n\n\n\n    Quaid can\'t repress a chuckle.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              Ya know, Doc, you could have folled\n\n              me.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              I\'m quite serious.

What you\'re experiencing\n\n              is a free-form delusion based on our\n\n              memory tapes.  But you\'re inventing\n\n              it yourself as you go along.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              Well, if this is my delusion, who\n\n              invited you?\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              I\'ve been artificially implanted as\n\n              an emergency measure.\n\n                   (gravely)\n\n              I\'m sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid,\n\n              but you\'ve suffered a schizoid embolism.\n\n              We can\'t snap you out of your fantasy.\n\n              I\'ve been sent in to try to talk you\n\n              down.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              How much is Cohaagen paying you for\n\n              this?\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Think about it.  Your dream started\n\n              in the middle of the implant procedure.\n\n              Everything after that--the chases, the\n\n              trip to Mars, your suite here at the\n\n              Hilton--these are all elements of your\n\n              Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid\n\n              to be a secret agent.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              Bullshit.  It\'s all coincidence.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              What about the girl?  Brunette,\n\n              athletic, sleazy and demure; just like\n\n              you specified.  Is that a coincidence?\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              She\'s real.  I dreamed about her before\n\n              I even went to Rekall.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself?\n\n              ""She\'s real because you dreamed her?""\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              That\'s right.\n\n\n\n    Edgemar sighs, discouraged.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Maybe this\'ll convince you.  Would you\n\n              mind opening the door?\n\n\n\n    Quaid jabs his gun into Edgemar\'s ribs.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              You open it.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              No need to be rude.  I\'ll do it.\n\n\n\n    Quaid shadows Edgemar as he opens the door.\n\n\n\n    Lori stands in the threshold!\n\n\n\n    Quaid does his best to absorb another shock.\n\n\n\n    Lori puts on a brave face, like holding back tears in front\n\n    of a sick child.  There is not the slightest indication that\n\n    she has even been anything but Quaid\'s adoring wife.\n\n\n\n                        LORI\n\n              Sweetheart...\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Come in, Mrs. Quaid.\n\n\n\n    Lori walks in hesitantly.

Abruptly, he swings his\n\n    gun at Edgemar and fires.\n\n\n\n    Edgemar\'s blood splatters in a dense circle on the wall.\n\n    Quaid spits the pill out onto Edgemar\'s blood-stained body.\n\n\n\n                        LORI\n\n              Now you\'ve done it!

FOUR MARS AGENTS storm through the big hole.\n\n\n\n    Quaid ducks, turns, and starts to rise, facing toward the\n\n    wall.\n\n\n\n    Agent #1 rushes Quaid.  Quaid ducks as Agent #1 goes to hit\n\n    Quaid with his gun, but goes over Quaid\'s shoulder.\n\n\n\n    Quaid rises and flips #1 over his right shoulder.  #1 lands on\n\n    bed.

Quaid then\n\n    elbows #2 in the chest then backhands #2 across the face.  #2\n\n    falls backwards.\n\n\n\n    Quaid then throws a right cross at #3, who falls backwards, as\n\n    Quaid follows through with his punch.  #4 comes in and kicks\n\n    Quaid in the stomach with his right foot.  Quaid reacts, then\n\n    backhands #4 across the face.  #4 hits the ground.\n\n\n\n    #2 comes in with a right leg kick at Quaid\'s left\n\n    shoulder/head.

And\n\n               I got the feeling that he was\n\n               disappointed that I never cut loose\n\n               on anyone, right...So, I\'m...I\'m\n\n               sitting in the locker room, and I\'m\n\n               taping up my knee.  And Larry\'s\n\n               undressing a couple lockers down\n\n               from me.  Yeah...he\'s kinda...\n\n               he\'s kinda skinny, weak.  And I\n\n               started thinking about my father,\n\n               and his attitude about weakness.\n\n               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I\n\n               jumped on top of him and started\n\n               wailing on him...And my friends,\n\n               they just laughed and cheered me on.\n\n               And afterwards, when I was sittin\'\n\n               in Vernon\'s office, all I could\n\n               think about was Larry\'s father. And\n\n               Larry havin\' to go home and...and\n\n               explain what happened to him.  And\n\n               the humiliation...fucking\n\n               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It\n\n               mustuv been unreal...I mean,\n\n                    (he\'s crying)\n\n               I mean, how do you apologize for\n\n               something like that?  There\'s no\n\n               way...it\'s all because of me and\n\n               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate\n\n               him!  He\'s like this...he\'s like\n\n               this mindless machine that I can\'t\n\n               even relate to anymore...""Andrew,\n\n               you\'ve got to be number one!

That\'s how he was born. He \n\n     took on our sins, he was tortured, \n\n     crucified -- but three days later he \n\n     rose again and was taken up to heaven. \n\n     Death was conquered, praise God! \n\n     Death was conquered, sins were \n\n     forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven\'s \n\n     now open to everyone.\n\n\n\nJesus can restrain himself no longer.

The homing device\n\n    glistens like an aluminum pea in a tiny claw at the end of\n\n    the tentacle.\n\n\n\n    Quaid takes the bloody pea, rolls it between his thumb and\n\n    forefinger, then shoves it into a Mars bar.'
 '98 INT. HILTON - QUAID\'S ROOM - DAY (LATE)  73                        98\n\n\n\n    Quaid lies forlorn on his bed in the dark, staring at the\n\n    TV, but not really watching.  The blue light of the television\n\n    flickers against the somber red of the setting sun.\n\n\n\n    ON TV:  COHAAGEN delivers a speech from his office.\n\n\n\n                        COHAAGEN\n\n              This afternoon at 4:30pm, I signed an\n\n              order declaring martial law throughout\n\n              the Mars Federal Colony.  I will not\n\n              tolerate any further damage to our\n\n              mineral export operations.  Mr. Kuato\n\n              and his terrorists must understand that\n\n              their self-defeating efforts will only\n\n              bring misery and suffering to the people\n\n              of Mars.\n\n\n\n    Quaid turns off the TV and stares at the ceiling.  He is\n\n    startled by a KNOCK AT THE DOOR.\n\n\n\n    Quaid sits up slowly, on alert.\n\n\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n\n                   (through door)\n\n              Mr. Quaid...?\n\n\n\n    Quaid picks up his gun.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              What?\n\n\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n\n              I need to talk to you--about Mr. Hauser.\n\n\n\n    Quaid COCKS his gun and approaches the door very cautiously,\n\n    from the side.\n\n\n\n                        QUAID\n\n              Who are you?\n\n\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n\n              Dr. Edgemar.

I\'m not armed.\n\n\n\n    All of a sudden, Quaid flings opens the door and takes\n\n    hair-trigger aim at...Dr. Edgemar from the Rekall\n\n    commercial!!!  He\'s dresses in the same tweed jacket.  Quaid\n\n    keeps the gun on Edgemar and glances up and down the hall.\n\n\n\n                        EDGEMAR\n\n              Don\'t worry; I\'m alone. --May I come\n\n              in?\n\n\n\n    Quaid roughly pulls Edgemar into the hotel room and closes\n\n    the door.

 ""INT. BUILDING SITE - DAY\n\n\n\nFADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in\n\nclouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at\n\na wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in\n\nlaborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the\n\nbricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and\n\nrelentlessly, like a machine.\n\n\n\nWe see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls\n\naway, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust\n\nand the growing hole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                              34.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFergus's face, as he works.\n\n\n\nThe hole. More bricks falling away. Through the clouds of\n\ndust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green.\n\n\n\nFergus's face, working. His rhythm slows.\n\n\n\nThe hole. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The\n\ndust begins to clear.\n\n\n\nHis face.\n\n\n\nThe jagged hole. The dust drifts across it, revealing a\n\ncricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the\n\ngreen.""
 ""INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.\n\n\n\nFergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk-light.\n\nThen he hears a voice.\n\n\n\n                        JUDE\n\n          Hello, stranger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                            69.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe sees Jude sitting in the corner. Her hair is now dark\n\nbrown.\n\n\n\n                        JUDE\n\n          You vanished.\n\n\n\nHe stares at her, says nothing.\n\n\n\n                        JUDE\n\n          What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the\n\n          gaff on us or did you just fuck up?\n\n\n\n                        FERGUS\n\n          Leave me alone, Jude.\n\n\n\n                        JUDE\n\n          No. That's the last thing I'll do. You\n\n          never asked what happened.\n\n\n\n                        FERGUS\n\n          I heard.\n\n\n\n                        JUDE\n\n          Eddie and Tinker died.\n\n\n\n                        FERGUS\n\n          I know.\n\n\n\n                        JUDE\n\n          Maguire and me got out by the skin of our\n\n          teeth.

Needed a\n\n          tougher look, if you know what I mean.\n\n\n\nShe lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black\n\nleather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch.\n\n\n\n                        JUDE\n\n          Fuck me, Fergus.\n\n\n\nHe takes her hand away.\n\n\n\n                        JUDE\n\n          Am I to take it that's a no?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       70.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says nothing.\n\n\n\n                     JUDE\n\n          We had a court-martial in your absence.\n\n          They wanted to put a bullet in your head.\n\n          I pleaded for clemency. Said we should\n\n          find out what happened first. So what did\n\n          happen?\n\n\n\n                     FERGUS\n\n          He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back.\n\n          I tried to catch him. He made it to the\n\n          road and got hit by a Saracen.\n\n\n\n                     JUDE\n\n          So you did fuck up.\n\n\n\n                     FERGUS\n\n          Yes.\n\n\n\n                     JUDE\n\n          But you know what the thing is, Fergus?\n\n\n\n                     FERGUS\n\n          No, what is the thing?\n\n\n\n                     JUDE\n\n          You vanished quite effectively.

And we'll need\n\n          a Mister Nobody to execute them.\n\n\n\n                     FERGUS\n\n          No way, Jude.

The\n\n          wee black chick.\n\n\n\nHe leaps up from the bed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                          71.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    FERGUS\n\n          Leave her out of this.\n\n\n\n                    JUDE\n\n          Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche.\n\n          You know we won't leave her out of this.\n\n          But I'm glad to see you care.\n\n\n\nShe brings her lips close to his so they touch.\n\n\n\n                    JUDE\n\n          And I must admit I'm curious.\n\n\n\nHe grabs her hair and pulls her head back.\n\n\n\n                    FERGUS\n\n          What the fuck do you know, Jude?\n\n\n\nShe pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth.\n\n\n\n                    JUDE\n\n          You fucking tell me, boy --\n\n\n\nFergus stares at her.

Keep your head down, Fergus. No\n\n          sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.\n\n          You'll be hearing from us.\n\n\n\nShe kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple.\n\n\n\n                    JUDE\n\n          Keep the faith.\n\n\n\nShe goes. Fergus stands in the darkness.""

Looks out the window to where he can see\n\nDil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have\n\ngathered. The wail of police sirens coming closer. He watches\n\nDil run off, with her funny walk. Then looks down and sees\n\nthe cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the\n\nhouse. He picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove\n\nDil's fingerprints.

The receptionist \n\n               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on \n\n               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their \n\n               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...\n\n\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n\n\n                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST\n\n                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?\n\n\n\n               There\'s no answer. We see that Juno\'s chair is EMPTY.\n\n\n\n               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door \n\n               drift shut. Juno\'s figure recedes into the distance as she \n\n               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.'

 'EXT. TOWNSQUARE - DAY\n\n\n\nPaul -- who we recognize as the Zealot Saul who killed Lazarus -- \n\npreaches to a handful of villagers.

I did everything. Whored, \n\n     drank, murdered. I killed anyone who \n\n     violated the Law of Moses. Then, I \n\n     was struck by a burning light and a \n\n     voice called to me, \'Saul, why are \n\n     you persecuting me? Why are you \n\n     against me?\' \'Who are you?\' I said. \n\n     \'Jesus,\' the voice said, and he gave \n\n     me my sight. I opened my eyes and I \n\n     was baptized and became Paul. I bring \n\n     the good news to every country.\n\n\n\nJesus comes closer, the Angel by his side.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     I bring this news. About Jesus of \n\n     Nazareth. He wasn\'t the son of Mary, \n\n     he was the son of God. His mother \n\n     was a virgin. The angel Gabriel came \n\n     to earth and put God\'s seed in her \n\n     womb. That\'s how he was born. He \n\n     took on our sins, he was tortured, \n\n     crucified -- but three days later he \n\n     rose again and was taken up to heaven. \n\n     Death was conquered, praise God! \n\n     Death was conquered, sins were \n\n     forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven\'s \n\n     now open to everyone.\n\n\n\nJesus can restrain himself no longer. He calls out:\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Did you ever see this resurrected \n\n     Jesus of Nazareth? I mean, with your \n\n     own eyes?\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     No. But I saw a blinding flash of \n\n     light and I heard his voice.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     You\'re a liar!\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     His disciples saw him. They were \n\n     hiding in an attic with the doors \n\n     locked when suddenly he appeared. \n\n     Only one, Thomas, wasn\'t convinced \n\n     but he put his fingers in his wounds \n\n     and gave Jesus some fish, which he \n\n     ate.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Liar!\n\n          (to people around him)\n\n     He\'s a liar!\n\n\n\nDisgusted, Jesus turns and walks away. His angel follows.\n\n\n\nIn the background, Paul comes after him.\n\n\n\nJesus feels Paul\'s footsteps drawing closer. He\'s about to \n\nexplode. Suddenly, he turns on his heel, grabs Paul by the \n\nshoulders and shakes him violently.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n          (continuing)\n\n     You\'re a liar! I\'m Jesus of Nazareth. \n\n     I was never crucified. I never came \n\n     back from the dead. I\'m a man like \n\n     everyone else.

James and John, \n\n     the sons of Zebedee, were my \n\n     disciples. We marched on Jerusalem, \n\n     they brought me before Pilate, but \n\n     God saved me.\n\n\n\nJesus\' Angel doesn\'t like this conversation; he tugs violently \n\nat his sleeve. Jesus shoves him aside. Paul takes Jesus around \n\na corner where they won\'t be seen.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     No he didn\'t!\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Now I live like a man.

Look at these people. \n\n     Do you see the suffering and \n\n     unhappiness in this world? Their \n\n     only hope is the Resurrected Jesus. \n\n     I don\'t care whether you\'re Jesus or \n\n     not.

And \n\n     I\'ll resurrect you too, whether you \n\n     like it or not.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     I won\'t let you.

We lean with her.  The sidewalk is\n\n     empty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the\n\n     house).  She's one floor up.  To her right is the house's\n\n     front stoop.\n\n     \n\n     She tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop.  Climbs up\n\n     onto the window ledge, and slithers out herself.\n\n     \n\n     We lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops\n\n     down onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror --\n\n     \n\n     -- at the video camera that covers the front stoop.\n\n     \n\n     ON THE MONITORS,\n\n     \n\n     we see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly\n\n     standing on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was\n\n     specifically told not to go.\n\n     \n\n     IN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\n     \n\n     Sarah sees the image of her on the stoop.  Raoul happens to\n\n     be looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to\n\n     turn around, to look at the monitors again --\n\n     \n\n     -- and Sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.\n\n     \n\n                          RAOUL\n\n               Hey!\n\n     \n\n     He turns, away from the monitors.\n\n     \n\n                          SARAH\n\n               Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.\n\n     \n\n     Raoul scowls at her.  Behind him --\n\n     \n\n     ON THE MONITORS,\n\n     \n\n     Meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on\n\n     the monitor.\n\n     \n\n     IN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\n     \n\n     Sarah sees her mother go.\n\n     \n\n                          SARAH\n\n                    (to Raoul)\n\n               Won't happen again.""]"

And\n\n               I got the feeling that he was\n\n               disappointed that I never cut loose\n\n               on anyone, right...So, I\'m...I\'m\n\n               sitting in the locker room, and I\'m\n\n               taping up my knee.  And Larry\'s\n\n               undressing a couple lockers down\n\n               from me.  Yeah...he\'s kinda...\n\n               he\'s kinda skinny, weak.  And I\n\n               started thinking about my father,\n\n               and his attitude about weakness.\n\n               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I\n\n               jumped on top of him and started\n\n               wailing on him...And my friends,\n\n               they just laughed and cheered me on.\n\n               And afterwards, when I was sittin\'\n\n               in Vernon\'s office, all I could\n\n               think about was Larry\'s father. And\n\n               Larry havin\' to go home and...and\n\n               explain what happened to him.  And\n\n               the humiliation...fucking\n\n               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It\n\n               mustuv been unreal...I mean,\n\n                    (he\'s crying)\n\n               I mean, how do you apologize for\n\n               something like that?  There\'s no\n\n               way...it\'s all because of me and\n\n               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate\n\n               him!  He\'s like this...he\'s like\n\n               this mindless machine that I can\'t\n\n               even relate to anymore...""Andrew,\n\n               you\'ve got to be number one!

It soon becomes\n\n     apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of\n\n     the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what\n\n     that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.\n\n\n\n     Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with\n\n     CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens\n\n     the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.\n\n\n\n     ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam\n\n     takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the\n\n     Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep\n\n     FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.\n\n\n\n                                                                       36.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER\n\n\n\n     The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the\n\n     accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles\n\n     of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is\n\n     an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped\n\n     inside.\n\n\n\n     Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his\n\n     body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching\n\n     for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.\n\n\n\n     With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door\n\n     open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --\n\n     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.\n\n\n\n     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,\n\n     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam\n\n     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and\n\n     turns the unconscious man onto his back.\n\n\n\n     He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans\n\n     down even closer.\n\n\n\n\n\n     CLOSE UP -- THE MAN\n\n\n\n     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as\n\n     we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of\n\n     the film.\n\n\n\n     Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the\n\n     REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has\n\n     just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n     WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER\n\n\n\n     Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious\n\n     Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him\n\n     to the parked Rover.\n\n\n\n                                                     CUT TO:""

 'EXT. TOWNSQUARE - DAY\n\n\n\nPaul -- who we recognize as the Zealot Saul who killed Lazarus -- \n\npreaches to a handful of villagers. Standing straight, \n\nradiating confidence, he speaks with the evangelistic fervor \n\nof a born-again Christian.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     I used to be a sinner. The worst \n\n     sinner. I did everything. Whored, \n\n     drank, murdered. I killed anyone who \n\n     violated the Law of Moses. Then, I \n\n     was struck by a burning light and a \n\n     voice called to me, \'Saul, why are \n\n     you persecuting me? Why are you \n\n     against me?\' \'Who are you?\' I said. \n\n     \'Jesus,\' the voice said, and he gave \n\n     me my sight. I opened my eyes and I \n\n     was baptized and became Paul. I bring \n\n     the good news to every country.\n\n\n\nJesus comes closer, the Angel by his side.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     I bring this news. About Jesus of \n\n     Nazareth. He wasn\'t the son of Mary, \n\n     he was the son of God. His mother \n\n     was a virgin. The angel Gabriel came \n\n     to earth and put God\'s seed in her \n\n     womb. That\'s how he was born. He \n\n     took on our sins, he was tortured, \n\n     crucified -- but three days later he \n\n     rose again and was taken up to heaven. \n\n     Death was conquered, praise God! \n\n     Death was conquered, sins were \n\n     forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven\'s \n\n     now open to everyone.\n\n\n\nJesus can restrain himself no longer. He calls out:\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Did you ever see this resurrected \n\n     Jesus of Nazareth? I mean, with your \n\n     own eyes?\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     No. But I saw a blinding flash of \n\n     light and I heard his voice.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     You\'re a liar!\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     His disciples saw him. They were \n\n     hiding in an attic with the doors \n\n     locked when suddenly he appeared. \n\n     Only one, Thomas, wasn\'t convinced \n\n     but he put his fingers in his wounds \n\n     and gave Jesus some fish, which he \n\n     ate.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Liar!\n\n          (to people around him)\n\n     He\'s a liar!\n\n\n\nDisgusted, Jesus turns and walks away. His angel follows.\n\n\n\nIn the background, Paul comes after him.\n\n\n\nJesus feels Paul\'s footsteps drawing closer. He\'s about to \n\nexplode. Suddenly, he turns on his heel, grabs Paul by the \n\nshoulders and shakes him violently.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n          (continuing)\n\n     You\'re a liar! I\'m Jesus of Nazareth. \n\n     I was never crucified. I never came \n\n     back from the dead. I\'m a man like \n\n     everyone else. Why are you spreading \n\n     these lies?\n\n\n\n          ANGEL\n\n     Quiet.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     What are you talking about?\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     I\'m the son of Mary and Joseph, who \n\n     preached in Galilee. James and John, \n\n     the sons of Zebedee, were my \n\n     disciples. We marched on Jerusalem, \n\n     they brought me before Pilate, but \n\n     God saved me.\n\n\n\nJesus\' Angel doesn\'t like this conversation; he tugs violently \n\nat his sleeve. Jesus shoves him aside. Paul takes Jesus around \n\na corner where they won\'t be seen.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     No he didn\'t!\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     Now I live like a man. I have a \n\n     family. I eat, work, have children. \n\n     Do you understand what I\'m saying? \n\n     Don\'t go around the world spreading \n\n     these lies about me.\n\n          (shouts)\n\n     Because, I\'ll tell everyone the truth.\n\n\n\nNow it\'s Paul\'s turn to explode.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     Look around you! Look at these people. \n\n     Do you see the suffering and \n\n     unhappiness in this world? Their \n\n     only hope is the Resurrected Jesus. \n\n     I don\'t care whether you\'re Jesus or \n\n     not. The Resurrected Jesus will save \n\n     the world -- that\'s what matters.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     The world can\'t be saved by lies.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     I created the truth. I make it out \n\n     of longing and faith. I don\'t struggle \n\n     to find truth -- I build it. If it\'s \n\n     necessary to crucify you to save the \n\n     world, then I\'ll crucify you. And \n\n     I\'ll resurrect you too, whether you \n\n     like it or not.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     I won\'t let you. I\'ll tell everyone \n\n     the truth.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     Shout all you want. Who\'ll believe \n\n     you? You started all this, now it \n\n     can\'t be stopped. The faithful will \n\n     grab you and call you a blasphemer \n\n     and throw you in a fire.\n\n\n\n          JESUS\n\n     No, that wouldn\'t happen.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n     How do you know? You don\'t know how \n\n     much people need God. You don\'t know \n\n     what a joy it is to hold the cross, \n\n     to put hope in the hearts of men, to \n\n     suffer, to be killed -- all for the \n\n     sake of Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus \n\n     of Nazareth, Son of God. Messiah.\n\n\n\nJesus is listening intently now.\n\n\n\n          PAUL\n\n          (continuing)\n\n     Not you. Not for your sake.\n\n          (pause)\n\n     I\'m glad I met you. Now I can forget \n\n     you. My Jesus is much more powerful.\n\n\n\nPaul returns to the townsquare to preach.

 'INT. MARY AND MARTHA\'S - NIGHT\n\n\n\nJesus lies dying. He is facing the entrance, in which we can \n\nsee glimmers of the still-burning sky.\n\n\n\nMary and Martha stand close around him.

He starts down the few \n\nstone steps into the room where Jesus lies. He is followed \n\nby two other men.

He wasn\'t the son of Mary, \n\n     he was the son of God. His mother \n\n     was a virgin. The angel Gabriel came \n\n     to earth and put God\'s seed in her \n\n     womb. That\'s how he was born. He \n\n     took on our sins, he was tortured, \n\n     crucified -- but three days later he \n\n     rose again and was taken up to heaven. \n\n     Death was conquered, praise God! \n\n     Death was conquered, sins were \n\n     forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven\'s \n\n     now open to everyone.\n\n\n\nJesus can restrain himself no longer.

The magazine selection is lots of \n\n               ""mommy mags"" and health related periodicals. She selects an \n\n               issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few \n\n               moments.\n\n\n\n               Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby \n\n               teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her \n\n               thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.\n\n\n\n               Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting \n\n               woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. \n\n               Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist \n\n               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on \n\n               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their \n\n               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...\n\n\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n\n\n                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST\n\n                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?\n\n\n\n               There\'s no answer. We see that Juno\'s chair is EMPTY.\n\n\n\n               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door \n\n               drift shut. Juno\'s figure recedes into the distance as she \n\n               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.'

The key slides out, back in\n\n     again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.\n\n     \n\n     The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,\n\n     which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.\n\n     Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.\n\n     \n\n     He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,\n\n     onto the window ledge.

The Harvester stationary. The Rover\n\n     caught beneath it.\n\n\n\n     No sign of the Girl.\n\n\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\n\n\n\n\n     BLACK.\n\n\n\n     Silence.

He\n\nopens the Rover's door and steps out to take a closer look.\n\n\n\n\n\nWIDE SHOT -- SAM 1/ROVER\n\n\n\nTaking in the Jammer and the adjacent Rover. Sam 1 loping\n\ntowards the Jammer, seemingly in slow motion.\n\n\n\nThe JAMMER is GIGANTIC --An intimidating, stark pole\n\nstabbed into the lunar landscape, like the worlds biggest\n\ncaber. Next to it Sam 1 is tiny, a white dot, as\n\ninsignificant as a pin prick.\n\n\n\nSam 1 and Sam 2\n\n\n\nWe cut back and forth between the two Sams as they both\n\ninvestigate the separate but identical-looking Jammers.\n\n\n\n                      SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n\n           I can just make out the top. Must\n\n           be a hundred feet tall at least.\n\n           It's huge!\n\n\n\n                     SAM 1\n\n           Whoever built these things meant\n\n           business. They weren't fucking\n\n           around.\n\n\n\nTheir voices ENERGIZED -- they are excited to have made\n\nthis discovery -- they aren't dealing with the negatives\n\nyet.\n\n\n\n                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)\n\n           What do you think?\n\n\n\n                     SAM 2\n\n           Its not an antennae, dude.

These things must be\n\n           blocking our signal.\n\n\n\nSuddenly Sam 1 doubles over. He vomits thick, viscous\n\nblood and sick into his helmet. Revolting.\n\n\n\nThe noise is AUDIBLE over the microphone.\n\n\n\n                                                                         62.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n\n                  You okay?\n\n\n\n      No answer from Sam 1. He COLLAPSES backwards onto the\n\n      ground. His chest LURCHES like he's been punched at from\n\n      the inside -- he spins over onto his front --\n\n\n\n                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n\n                  Sam?\n\n\n\n      Sam 1 manages to climb to his feet -- heads slowly back to\n\n      the Rover -- he dips in, closes the door.\n\n\n\n                            SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n\n                  Sam, can you hear me?\n\n\n\n                             SAM 1\n\n                  Yeah, I hear you.\n\n                      (then)\n\n                  I'm going to head back to base.\n\n                  I'm not feeling too good.\n\n\n\n                            SAM 2\n\n                  I'll stay out here a little\n\n                  longer. I want to see if there\n\n                  are any more of these things.\n\n\n\n      Sam 1 pulls a U-turn and begins his journey back to base.\n\n\n\n      Sam 2 remains out by his Jammer, investigating further.\n\n\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n\n\n\n\n106   I/E.

 ""77   EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                       77\n\n\n\n     Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes\n\n     apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of\n\n     the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what\n\n     that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.\n\n\n\n     Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with\n\n     CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens\n\n     the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.\n\n\n\n     ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam\n\n     takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the\n\n     Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep\n\n     FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.\n\n\n\n                                                                       36.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER\n\n\n\n     The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the\n\n     accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles\n\n     of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is\n\n     an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped\n\n     inside.\n\n\n\n     Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his\n\n     body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching\n\n     for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.\n\n\n\n     With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door\n\n     open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --\n\n     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.\n\n\n\n     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,\n\n     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam\n\n     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and\n\n     turns the unconscious man onto his back.\n\n\n\n     He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans\n\n     down even closer.\n\n\n\n\n\n     CLOSE UP -- THE MAN\n\n\n\n     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as\n\n     we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of\n\n     the film.\n\n\n\n     Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the\n\n     REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has\n\n     just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n     WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER\n\n\n\n     Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious\n\n     Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him\n\n     to the parked Rover.\n\n\n\n                                                     CUT TO:""
