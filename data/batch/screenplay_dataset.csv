0,Panic Room,"INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 20

     

     In the master bedroom, a message appears on the alarm panel:

     

     ZONE 19 DISABLED","Recently divorced Meg Altman (Foster) and her 11-year-old daughter Sarah (Stewart) have just purchased a four-story brownstone on the Upper West Side of New York City.
The house's previous owner, a reclusive millionaire, installed an isolated room used to protect the house's occupants from intruders.
The ""panic room"" is protected by concrete and steel on all sides, a thick steel door, and an extensive security system with multiple surveillance cameras, a public announcement system, and a separate phone line.
On the night the two move into the home, it is broken into by Junior (Leto), the previous owner's grandson; Burnham (Whitaker), an employee of the residence's security company; and Raoul (Yoakam), a ski mask-wearing gunman recruited by Junior.
The three are after $3 million in bearer bonds, which are locked inside a floor safe in the panic room.

After discovering that the Altmans have moved in earlier than expected, Junior convinces a reluctant Burnham, who assumed the house was unoccupied, to continue with their heist.
As they begin the robbery, Meg wakes up and happens to see the intruders on the video monitors in the panic room.
Before the three can reach them, Meg and Sarah run into the panic room and close the door behind them, only to find that the burglars have disabled the telephone.
Intending to force the two out of the room, Burnham introduces propane gas into the room's air vents.
Raoul, in conflict with Burnham and Junior, dangerously increases the amount of gas.
Unable to seal the vents, Meg ignites the gas while she and Sarah cover themselves with fireproof blankets, causing an explosion which vents into the room outside and causes a fire, injuring Junior.

The Altmans make several attempts to call for help, including signaling a neighbor with a flashlight through the opening of a ventilation pipe, but the neighbor ignores it.
Meg then taps into the main telephone line and gets through to her ex-husband Stephen (Bauchau), before the burglars cut them off.

When all attempts to get into the room fail, Junior lets slip that there is much more money in the safe than he let on, and gives up on the robbery.
About to leave the house, he is shot by Raoul, who forces Burnham, at gunpoint, to finish the robbery.
Stephen arrives at the home and is taken hostage by Burnham and Raoul—who severely beats him.
To make matters worse, Sarah, who has diabetes, suffers a seizure.
Her emergency glucagon syringe is in a refrigerator outside the panic room.
After using an unconscious Stephen to trick Meg into momentarily leaving the panic room, Burnham enters it, finding Sarah motionless on the floor.
After retrieving the syringe for Sarah, Meg struggles briefly with Raoul, who is thrown into the panic room, his gun knocked out of his hand.
As Meg throws the syringe into the panic room, Burnham frantically locks himself, Raoul, and Sarah inside, crushing Raoul's hand in the sliding steel door.
Meg, who now has the gun, begs the two intruders over the PA system to give Sarah the injection.
After some time Burnham, who has shown no interest in hurting either Meg or Sarah throughout the film, gives Sarah the injection.
While doing so, he tells Sarah he did not want this, and the only reason he agreed to participate was to give his own child a better life.
After Burnham gives Sarah the injection, Sarah thanks him and tells Meg that Sarah is now alright.

Having earlier received a call from Stephen, two policemen arrive, which prompts Raoul to threaten Sarah's life.
Sensing the potential danger to her daughter, Meg lies to the officers and they leave.
Meanwhile, Burnham opens the safe and removes the $22 million in bearer bonds inside.
As the robbers attempt to leave, using Sarah as a hostage, Meg hits Raoul with a sledgehammer and Burnham flees.
After a badly injured Stephen shoots at Raoul and misses, Raoul disables him and prepares to kill Meg with the sledgehammer, but Burnham, upon hearing Sarah's screams of pain, returns to the house and shoots Raoul dead, stating, ""You'll be okay now"", to Meg and her daughter before leaving.
The police, alerted by Meg's suspicious behavior earlier, arrive in force and capture Burnham, who lets the bearer bonds go; they fly away with the wind.

Later, Meg and Sarah, having recovered from their harrowing experience, begin searching the newspaper for a new home.","INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 20

36,Panic Room,"INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

     

     A HAND comes down into frame and picks up the Glucogen and

     the leather pouch.  Burnham stands, looking down at them.

     Raoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.

     

                          RAOUL

               You're wasting your fucking time,

               man, you're wasting my time.  You

               don't know how to do this, and the

               longer we stay in here, the more

               likely she's gonna lose it and call

               the cops!

     

                          BURNHAM

               Are you gonna open the safe?

     

     Raoul looks at him.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Then shut up and get out of my way.

     

     As Burnham crosses the room, Raoul makes eye contact with

     Sarah, who is staring at him.

     

                          RAOUL

               Don't look at me.

     

     ACROSS THE ROOM,

     

     Burnham drops to his knees next to Sarah and unzips the

     pouch.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Okay, kid, all I know about this is

               what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk

               me through it.

     

     Sarah tries to form words, but she's too weak.  Burnham

     swallows.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV

               don't lie, right?

     

     He reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad,

     and a length of rubber tubing.  He takes Sarah's arm,

     stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.

     

                          BURNHAM

               You seem like a good kid.  Your

               mom... only saw her for a second,

               but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?

     

     No answer.  Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's

     arm, pulls it tight.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Hey, nod or something, show me

               you're still alive, will ya?

     

     Sarah nods.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Attagirl.  That too tight?

     

     Sarah shakes her head no.  Burnham takes the syringe, starts

     to fill it from the Glucogen bottle.

     

                          BURNHAM

               You guys are pretty rich, huh?

     

     Sarah shrugs.  While Burnham goes through the process of

     finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he

     goes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:

     

                          BURNHAM

               Yeah, you don't think about that

               stuff.  Good for you.

     

     He looks at her, sees her looking at him.  Thinking about

     him.

     

                          BURNHAM

               I know, I know.  I really screwed

               the pooch this time.  I never did

               anything like this before.  Break

               into somebody's house?  Not even

               close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to

               God, I been on the wrong end of

               maybe six straight years of bad

               cards.  House.  Car.  Wife.

                    (snaps his fingers --

                     gone)

               Those are some seriously bad cards.

               And still, every time I pick up a

               fresh hand I swear to God, the rush

               comes so hot and prickly I feel it

               right down to my toes because this

               time, this one time, it might be

               there, this time it might be that

               hand, that perfect hand, that

               monster hand.

                    (shakes his head)

               And you thought you were sick.

     

     The shot successfully given, he pulls Sarah's sleeve back

     down.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Feel better?

     

     Sarah nods, and she seems better already.  Burnham helps her

     to sit up, to lean against the wall.

     

                          BURNHAM

               Woulda been a hell of a dad.

About to leave the house, he is shot by Raoul, who forces Burnham, at gunpoint, to finish the robbery.
Stephen arrives at the home and is taken hostage by Burnham and Raoul—who severely beats him.
To make matters worse, Sarah, who has diabetes, suffers a seizure.
Her emergency glucagon syringe is in a refrigerator outside the panic room.
After using an unconscious Stephen to trick Meg into momentarily leaving the panic room, Burnham enters it, finding Sarah motionless on the floor.
After retrieving the syringe for Sarah, Meg struggles briefly with Raoul, who is thrown into the panic room, his gun knocked out of his hand.
As Meg throws the syringe into the panic room, Burnham frantically locks himself, Raoul, and Sarah inside, crushing Raoul's hand in the sliding steel door.
Meg, who now has the gun, begs the two intruders over the PA system to give Sarah the injection.
After some time Burnham, who has shown no interest in hurting either Meg or Sarah throughout the film, gives Sarah the injection.
While doing so, he tells Sarah he did not want this, and the only reason he agreed to participate was to give his own child a better life.
After Burnham gives Sarah the injection, Sarah thanks him and tells Meg that Sarah is now alright.

Having earlier received a call from Stephen, two policemen arrive, which prompts Raoul to threaten Sarah's life.
Sensing the potential danger to her daughter, Meg lies to the officers and they leave.
Meanwhile, Burnham opens the safe and removes the $22 million in bearer bonds inside.
As the robbers attempt to leave, using Sarah as a hostage, Meg hits Raoul with a sledgehammer and Burnham flees.
After a badly injured Stephen shoots at Raoul and misses, Raoul disables him and prepares to kill Meg with the sledgehammer, but Burnham, upon hearing Sarah's screams of pain, returns to the house and shoots Raoul dead, stating, ""You'll be okay now"", to Meg and her daughter before leaving.
The police, alerted by Meg's suspicious behavior earlier, arrive in force and capture Burnham, who lets the bearer bonds go; they fly away with the wind.

     clothes.

     

     The Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across

     the street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind.

     

     He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob.

     We hear a key slide into the door, rattle.

     

     But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in

     again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.

     

     The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,

     which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.

     Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.

     

     He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,

     onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't

     tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for

     something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE.

     

     The fire escape.

     

     The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of

     vision.

     

     We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We

     start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in

     the kitchen, toward the stairwell."

                        MCCLANE

                   (to Tiffany)

              Don't let her leave



    McClane strides into the memory studio, ready to kick ass,

    but he pulls up short at what he sees and hears.



    Quaid shouts and thrashes about in the chair, violently

    struggling to break the straps that hold him down.  He's like

    a different person:  a caged animal.



                        QUAID

              You're dead, all of you!  You blew my

              cover.



    Terrified, Dr. Lull and Ernie keep a safe distance from Quaid.

    McClane is merely aggravated.



                        MCCLANE

              What the fuck is going on here?!  You

              can't install a simple goddamn double

              implant?!



                        DR. LULL

              It's not my fault.  We hit a memory

              cap.



                        QUAID

              They'll be here any minute!  They'll

              kill you all!



                        MCCLANE

              What's he talking about?



                        QUAID

              Let me go!



    McClane walks up to Quaid and examines his eyes.



                        MCCLANE

              Mr. Quaid, try and calm down.



    Quaid breaks the strap holding his right arm and grabs McClane

    by the throat.



                        QUAID

                   (quietly menacing)

              My name's not Quaid.



    McClane, choking, tries to pry Quaid's hand from his neck,

    but he can't loosen the iron grip.



                        QUAID

              Untie me.



    Ernie rushes over and unsuccessfully tries to wrestle Quaid's

    arm down, using his full body weight.  McClane's eyes are

    bulging.



    Dr. Lull frantically jabs a SYRINGE GUN into Quaid's thigh

    and fires dose after does until Quaid's grip weakens and he

    passes out.



    McClane falls to the ground, gagging.  Dr. Lull goes over

    to help him.



                        DR. LULL

              Are you all right?



    McClane shoves her away and gasps for breath.



                        DR. LULL (CONT'D)

              Listen to me!  He's been going on and

              on about Mars.

                   (frightened)

              He's really been there.



                        MCCLANE

                   (raspy)

              Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's

              acting out the secret agent role from

              his Ego Trip!



                        DR. LULL

                   (superior)

              I'm afraid that's not possible.



                        MCCLANE

                   (condescending)

              Why not?



                        DR. LULL

              We haven't implanted it yet.



    McClane falls silent.  Suddenly he's terrified.



                        MCCLANE

              Oh shit....Oh shit...



                        DR. LULL

              I've been trying to tell you.  Someone

              erased his memory.



                        ERNIE

                   (hysterical)

              Excuse me, someone?  We're talking the

              fucking Agency!



                        DR. LULL

              Shut up!



                        TIFFANY

              Bob, the client's gone.



    WHACK!  Dr. Lull SLAPS Ernie across the face.  Her violent

    act shocks everyone to silence, including herself.  McClane

    tries to think.



                        MCCLANE

              Okay, this is what we're gonna do.

              Renata, cover up any memory he has of

              us or Rekall.



                        DR. LULL

              I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy

              in there.



                        MCCLANE

              Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the

              corner.  Tiffany, you help him.

                   (Ernie nods)

              I'll destroy his file and refund his

              money.

                   (stands)

              And if anybody comes asking...we've

              never heard of Douglas Quaid.



                        DR. LULL

              Come on...put his head in place.



    They look at Quaid, sprawled unconscious in the chair.","In 2084, Douglas Quaid is an Earthbound construction worker having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there.
His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting rebels while searching for a rumored alien artifact located in the mines.
At ""Rekall"", a company that provides memory implants of vacation, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent.
However, during the procedure, Quaid violently reacts before the memory is implanted.
The company re-sedates him, wipes his memory of the Rekall visit, and sends him home.
On the way home, Quaid is attacked by his co-workers and is forced to kill them.
He then is attacked by armed thugs led by Lori and Richter, her real husband and Cohaagen's subordinate.

After evading his attackers, Quaid is given a suitcase containing money, gadgets, and a video recording.
The video is of Quaid, apparently called ""Hauser"", who explains that he used to work for Cohaagen but learned about the artifact, and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself.
The ""Hauser"" instructs Quaid on removing a tracking device, before ordering him to go to Mars and meet ""Kuato"".
Quaid makes his way to Mars and follows clues to Venusville, the colony's red-light district populated by a people mutated by poor radiation shielding.
He meets Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that Quaid is working for Cohaagen.

Quaid later encounters Lori and Rekall's President, Dr. Edgemar.
Edgemar insists Quaid is living out the implanted memories, and offers Quaid a pill that would wake him from the dream.
Quaid however sees Edgemar sweating in fear, and kills him instead.
Richter's forces capture Quaid, but Melina rescues him with Quaid killing Lori in the process.
The two race back to the Venusville bar and escape into the tunnels with their taxi driver Benny.
Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation to Venusville, slowly suffocating its citizens.
Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to Kuato, a deformed humanoid conjoined to his brother's stomach.
Kuato reads Quaid's mind and learns that the artifact is a turbinium reactor that will create a breathable atmosphere for Mars when activated, eliminating Cohaagen's abusive monopoly on breathable air.
Cohaagen's forces burst in, led by Benny, and kill most of the resistance, including Kuato, who instructs Quaid to start the reactor.

Quaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who reveals the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and lead Cohaagen to Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance.
Cohaagen orders Hauser's memory to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina to be programmed to be Hauser's slave, but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located.
They work their way to the control room of the reactor, killing Benny, Richter, and the rest of his men.

While running away in the reactor, Cohaagen confronts them in the control room with a bomb.
but Quaid accidentally sets it off, blowing out one of the walls of the control room, causing an explosive decompression.
Quaid grabs on the wall, but knocks Coohagen out, which causes him to land on the surface of Mars.
Due to the low atmospheric pressure, his internal fluids boil out, killing him.
Quaid manages to activate the reactor before he and Melina are also pulled out.
The reactor releases air into the Martian atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina and the population of Venusville.
As humans walk onto the surface of the planet in its new atmosphere, Quaid takes a moment to wonder whether he is still living the memory before turning to kiss Melina.","REKALL - MEMORY STUDIO - DUSK  17                             22

    Quaid lies forlorn on his bed in the dark, staring at the

    TV, but not really watching.  The blue light of the television

    flickers against the somber red of the setting sun.



    ON TV:  COHAAGEN delivers a speech from his office.



                        COHAAGEN

              This afternoon at 4:30pm, I signed an

              order declaring martial law throughout

              the Mars Federal Colony.  I will not

              tolerate any further damage to our

              mineral export operations.  Mr. Kuato

              and his terrorists must understand that

              their self-defeating efforts will only

              bring misery and suffering to the people

              of Mars.



    Quaid turns off the TV and stares at the ceiling.  He is

    startled by a KNOCK AT THE DOOR.



    Quaid sits up slowly, on alert.



                        VOICE (O.S.)

                   (through door)

              Mr. Quaid...?



    Quaid picks up his gun.



                        QUAID

              What?



                        VOICE (O.S.)

              I need to talk to you--about Mr. Hauser.



    Quaid COCKS his gun and approaches the door very cautiously,

    from the side.



                        QUAID

              Who are you?



                        VOICE (O.S.)

              Dr. Edgemar.  From Rekall.



                        QUAID

                   (stunned, incredulous)

              How did you find me?



                        EDGEMAR (O.S.)

              It's difficult to explain...Could you

              open the door, please.  I'm not armed.



    All of a sudden, Quaid flings opens the door and takes

    hair-trigger aim at...Dr. Edgemar from the Rekall

    commercial!!!  He's dresses in the same tweed jacket.  Quaid

    keeps the gun on Edgemar and glances up and down the hall.



                        EDGEMAR

              Don't worry; I'm alone. --May I come

              in?



    Quaid roughly pulls Edgemar into the hotel room and closes

    the door.  He frisks Edgemar and find to weapon.



                        QUAID

              What do you want?



                        EDGEMAR

              This is going to be very difficult for

              you at accept, Mr. Quaid.



                        QUAID

              I'm listening.



                        EDGEMAR

              I'm afraid you're not really standing

              here right now.



    Quaid can't repress a chuckle.

              Ya know, Doc, you could have folled

              me.

              I'm quite serious.  You're not here,

              and neither am I.



    Quaid squeezes Edgemar's shoulder, verifying its solidity.



                        QUAID

              Amazing.  Where are we?



                        EDGEMAR

              At Rekall.



    Quaid's cockiness wavers.



                        EDGEMAR (CONT'D)

              You're strapped into an implant chair,

              and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe

              console.



                        QUAID

              Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this

              is all part of that delightful vacation

              your company sold me.



                        EDGEMAR

              Not exactly.  What you're experiencing

              is a free-form delusion based on our

              memory tapes.  But you're inventing

              it yourself as you go along.



                        QUAID

              Well, if this is my delusion, who

              invited you?



                        EDGEMAR

              I've been artificially implanted as

              an emergency measure.

                   (gravely)

              I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid,

              but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

              We can't snap you out of your fantasy.

              I've been sent in to try to talk you

              down.



                        QUAID

              How much is Cohaagen paying you for

              this?



                        EDGEMAR

              Think about it.  Your dream started

              in the middle of the implant procedure.

              Everything after that--the chases, the

              trip to Mars, your suite here at the

              Hilton--these are all elements of your

              Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid

              to be a secret agent.



                        QUAID

              Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.



                        EDGEMAR

              What about the girl?  Brunette,

              athletic, sleazy and demure; just like

              you specified.  Is that a coincidence?



                        QUAID

              She's real.  I dreamed about her before

              I even went to Rekall.



                        EDGEMAR

              Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself?

              ""She's real because you dreamed her?""



                        QUAID

              That's right.



    Edgemar sighs, discouraged.



                        EDGEMAR

              Maybe this'll convince you.  Would you

              mind opening the door?



    Quaid jabs his gun into Edgemar's ribs.



                        QUAID

              You open it.



                        EDGEMAR

              No need to be rude.  I'll do it.



    Quaid shadows Edgemar as he opens the door.



    Lori stands in the threshold!



    Quaid does his best to absorb another shock.



    Lori puts on a brave face, like holding back tears in front

    of a sick child.  There is not the slightest indication that

    she has even been anything but Quaid's adoring wife.



                        LORI

              Sweetheart...



                        EDGEMAR

              Come in, Mrs. Quaid.



    Lori walks in hesitantly.  Quaid pulls her to him and roughly

    frisks her.



                        QUAID

              I suppose you're not here either.



                        LORI

              I'm here at Rekall.



    Quaid laughs and roughly pushes her away.



                        LORI (CONT'D)

                   (crushed)

              I love you.



                        QUAID

              Right.  That's why you tried to kill

              me.



                        LORI

              Nooo!  I would never do anything to

              hurt you.  I want you to come back to

              me.



                        QUAID

              Bullshit.



    Lori's heart is breaking, but Quaid's is cold as ice.



                        EDGEMAR

              What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid?

                   (reasonable)

              That you're having a paranoid episode

              triggered by acute neuro-chemical

              trauma?

                   (derisive)

              Or that you're really an invincible

              secret agent from Mars who's the victim

              of an interplanetary conspiracy to make

              him think he's a lowly construction

              worker?



    Quaid's certainty in undermined.  Edgemar looks at him with

    great sympathy and kindness.



                        EDGEMAR (CONT'D)

              Stop punishing yourself, Doug.  You're

              a fine, upstanding man.  You have a

              beautiful wife who loves you.



                        LORI

              I do.



    Lori beams at him with pure affection.



                        EDGEMAR (CONT'D)

              Your whole life is ahead of you...

              But you've got to want to return to

              reality.



    Quaid is half-convinced, but doesn't want to show it.



                        QUAID

              Suppose I do...then what?



                        EDGEMAR

              Swallow this.



    Edgemar opens his hand, revealing a small pill.



                        QUAID

              What is it?



                        EDGEMAR

              It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return

              to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll

              fall asleep.



    Quaid picks up the pill and examines it.



                        QUAID

              All right.  Let's say you're telling

              the truth, and this is all a dream...



    Realizing something, Quaid raises his gun to Edgemar's head.



                        QUAID (CONT'D)

              Then I can pull this trigger, and it

              won't matter.



                        LORI

              Doug, don't!



    Edgemar remains preternaturally calm.  His eyes and voice

    express his unselfish concern for Quaid.



                        EDGEMAR

              It won't make the slightest difference

              to me, Doug, but the consequences to

              you would be devastating.  In your mind,

              I'll be dead.  And with no one to guide

              you out, you'll be stuck in permanent

              psychosis.



                        LORI

              Doug, let Dr. Edgemar help you.



    Finger on the trigger, Quaid is torn with doubt.



                        EDGEMAR

              The walls of reality will come crashing

              down.  One minute you'll be the savior

              of the rebel cause, then, next thing

              you know, you'll be Cohaagen's bosom

              buddy.  You'll even have ridiculous

              fantasies about alien civilizations--as

              you requested.  But in the end, back

              on Earth...You'll be lobotomized.



    Quaid becomes totally demoralized.



                        EDGEMAR (CONT'D)

                   (firm)

              So get a grip on yourself, Doug.  And

              put down the gun.



    Edgemar stares hard.  Quaid hesitantly lowers the gun.



                        EDGEMAR (CONT'D)

              Good... Now take the pill and put it

              in your mouth.



    Quaid puts the pill in his mouth.



                        EDGEMAR (CONT'D)

              Swallow it.



    Quaid hesitates.  Edgemar and Lori watch with great

    anticipation.



                        LORI

              Go ahead, sweetheart.



    Quaid is wracked with indecision.  Then he sees a single drop

    of sweat trickle down Edgemar's brow.  Abruptly, he swings his

    gun at Edgemar and fires.



    Edgemar's blood splatters in a dense circle on the wall.

    Quaid spits the pill out onto Edgemar's blood-stained body.



                        LORI

              Now you've done it!  Now you've done

              it!



    BOOM!  The blood stain EXPLODES, blasting Quaid backwards

    through the air.  FOUR MARS AGENTS storm through the big hole.



    Quaid ducks, turns, and starts to rise, facing toward the

    wall.



    Agent #1 rushes Quaid.  Quaid ducks as Agent #1 goes to hit

    Quaid with his gun, but goes over Quaid's shoulder.



    Quaid rises and flips #1 over his right shoulder.  #1 lands on

    bed.  As Quaid recovers, Agent #2 grabs Quaid's right arm.

    Agent #3 grabs Quaid's left arm, and Agent #4 comes in to hit

    Quaid.



    Quaid kicks #4 in the chest.  #4 flies backward.  Quaid then

    elbows #2 in the chest then backhands #2 across the face.  #2

    falls backwards.



    Quaid then throws a right cross at #3, who falls backwards, as

    Quaid follows through with his punch.  #4 comes in and kicks

    Quaid in the stomach with his right foot.  Quaid reacts, then

    backhands #4 across the face.  #4 hits the ground.



    #2 comes in with a right leg kick at Quaid's left

    shoulder/head.  Quaid grabs the leg and throws him.

    Instantly, #3 is rising up behind Quaid and hits him on the

    back of the head with his gun.  Quaid collapses and tries to

    crawl away towards the door.



    #1 grabs Quaid by the collar and shirt.  #4 grabs his left

    leg, and they try and restrain him.



    Then Lori steps in and kicks across the face, moves around to

    the other side and kicks him in the balls.  He stops

    resisting.



    Lori kicks him across the face again, Quaid falls backwards,

    unconscious.



                        LORI

              That's for making me come to Mars.

              You know how much I hate this fucking

              planet.  Cuff him.



    Lori looks down triumphantly and speaks into a wireless

    MINI-VIDEOPHONE.



                        LORI (CONT'D)

              I've got him.","In 2084, Douglas Quaid is an Earthbound construction worker having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there.
His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting rebels while searching for a rumored alien artifact located in the mines.
At ""Rekall"", a company that provides memory implants of vacation, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent.
However, during the procedure, Quaid violently reacts before the memory is implanted.
The company re-sedates him, wipes his memory of the Rekall visit, and sends him home.
On the way home, Quaid is attacked by his co-workers and is forced to kill them.
He then is attacked by armed thugs led by Lori and Richter, her real husband and Cohaagen's subordinate.

After evading his attackers, Quaid is given a suitcase containing money, gadgets, and a video recording.
The video is of Quaid, apparently called ""Hauser"", who explains that he used to work for Cohaagen but learned about the artifact, and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself.
The ""Hauser"" instructs Quaid on removing a tracking device, before ordering him to go to Mars and meet ""Kuato"".
Quaid makes his way to Mars and follows clues to Venusville, the colony's red-light district populated by a people mutated by poor radiation shielding.
He meets Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that Quaid is working for Cohaagen.

Quaid later encounters Lori and Rekall's President, Dr. Edgemar.
Edgemar insists Quaid is living out the implanted memories, and offers Quaid a pill that would wake him from the dream.
Quaid however sees Edgemar sweating in fear, and kills him instead.
Richter's forces capture Quaid, but Melina rescues him with Quaid killing Lori in the process.
The two race back to the Venusville bar and escape into the tunnels with their taxi driver Benny.
Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation to Venusville, slowly suffocating its citizens.
Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to Kuato, a deformed humanoid conjoined to his brother's stomach.
Kuato reads Quaid's mind and learns that the artifact is a turbinium reactor that will create a breathable atmosphere for Mars when activated, eliminating Cohaagen's abusive monopoly on breathable air.
Cohaagen's forces burst in, led by Benny, and kill most of the resistance, including Kuato, who instructs Quaid to start the reactor.

Quaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who reveals the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and lead Cohaagen to Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance.
Cohaagen orders Hauser's memory to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina to be programmed to be Hauser's slave, but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located.
They work their way to the control room of the reactor, killing Benny, Richter, and the rest of his men.

While running away in the reactor, Cohaagen confronts them in the control room with a bomb.
but Quaid accidentally sets it off, blowing out one of the walls of the control room, causing an explosive decompression.
Quaid grabs on the wall, but knocks Coohagen out, which causes him to land on the surface of Mars.
Due to the low atmospheric pressure, his internal fluids boil out, killing him.
Quaid manages to activate the reactor before he and Melina are also pulled out.
The reactor releases air into the Martian atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina and the population of Venusville.
As humans walk onto the surface of the planet in its new atmosphere, Quaid takes a moment to wonder whether he is still living the memory before turning to kiss Melina.","HILTON - QUAID'S ROOM - DAY (LATE)  73                        98

                        GEORGE

              Put these on.  We're going outside.



    As Quaid starts to put on a spacesuit, he hears GUNSHOTS next

    to him,inside the airlock.  He sees George's body jerking to

    the staccato report of gunfire.



    Benny is the villain, in full control of his rifle.



    Quaid lunges for Benny, but before he can grab him, Benny

    takes Melina hostage, with his gun pointed at her head.



                        BENNY

              Freeze!



    Quaid and Melina can hardly believe their eyes.  Benny breaks

    into a wide smile.



                        BENNY (CONT'D)

              Congratulations, Quaid.  You led us

              right to him.



    Quaid and Melina are devastated.  After a moment, Quaid kneels

    down to examine George/Kuato's lifeless form.



                        MELINA

              How could you do this?  You're a mutant.



                        BENNY

              Hey, I got four kids to feed.



                        QUAID

              married.

                   (suddenly fierce)

              Now put your fucking hands in the air!



    As Quaid complies with the order, Benny edges over and

    vigorously kicks open the bolt on the airlock door.  He's not

    the geek he seemed to be.



    Richter and soldiers are approaching in the tunnel and enter

    the airlock.



    Kuato, barely alive, gags out a word.



                        KUATO

              Quaid...Quaid.



    Quaid leans close as Richter and solders comes to a stop.

              Forget it, bro.  His fortune telling

              days are over.

              Start the reactor...Free Mars.



    A burst of gunfire finishes off Kuato.  Quaid spins around

    angrily and finds a rifle pointed directly in his face.

    Richter stands at the airlock door, holding the gun.  He wants

    to pull the trigger real bad.

    to him,inside the airlock. He sees George's body jerking to

    the staccato report of gunfire. Benny is the villain, in full control of his rifle. Quaid lunges for Benny, but before he can grab him, Benny

    takes Melina hostage, with his gun pointed at her head. Quaid and Melina can hardly believe their eyes. BENNY (CONT'D)

              Congratulations, Quaid. After a moment, Quaid kneels

    down to examine George/Kuato's lifeless form. MELINA

              Now put your fucking hands in the air! As Quaid complies with the order, Benny edges over and

    vigorously kicks open the bolt on the airlock door. Richter and soldiers are approaching in the tunnel and enter

    the airlock. Quaid leans close as Richter and solders comes to a stop. His fortune telling

              days are over. Kuato grabs Quaid's collar and pulls him nearer. KUATO

              Start the reactor...Free Mars. Quaid spins around

    angrily and finds a rifle pointed directly in his face. Richter stands at the airlock door, holding the gun. He wants

    to pull the trigger real bad. RICHTER

The video is of Quaid, apparently called ""Hauser"", who explains that he used to work for Cohaagen but learned about the artifact, and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself.
The ""Hauser"" instructs Quaid on removing a tracking device, before ordering him to go to Mars and meet ""Kuato"".

He meets Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that Quaid is working for Cohaagen.

Quaid later encounters Lori and Rekall's President, Dr. Edgemar.
Edgemar insists Quaid is living out the implanted memories, and offers Quaid a pill that would wake him from the dream.

Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to Kuato, a deformed humanoid conjoined to his brother's stomach.
Kuato reads Quaid's mind and learns that the artifact is a turbinium reactor that will create a breathable atmosphere for Mars when activated, eliminating Cohaagen's abusive monopoly on breathable air.
Cohaagen's forces burst in, led by Benny, and kill most of the resistance, including Kuato, who instructs Quaid to start the reactor.

Quaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who reveals the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and lead Cohaagen to Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance.
Cohaagen orders Hauser's memory to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina to be programmed to be Hauser's slave, but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located.

    ON TV:  Hauser reaches into the same satchel that Quaid picked

    up at the pawn shop.



                        HAUSER

              First, let's get rid of that bug in

              your head.

                   (holds up plastic bag)

              Take this thing out of the case and

              stick it up your nose.  Don't worry;

              it's self guiding.  Just shove real

              hard...



    Quaid throws the remainder of his Mars bar to the rats and

    takes out ""the thingy in the plastic bag"".  He tears it open

    and removes a surgical instrument that looks like the metallic

    tentacle of an alien.



                        HAUSER (CONT'D)

              When you hear the crunch, you're there.

              Just pull it out.



    He sticks the tentacle up his nose and shoves.  Whoa!  Quaid

    grimaces with pain.



                        HAUSER (CONT'D)

              And be careful.  It's my head, too.



    The recorded message freeze-frames.  Quaid warily sits down

    and continues with the procedure.



    As the instrument winds through his sinuses, Quaid's face

    bulges and distorts.  The pain grows more and more intense

    until CRUNCH!  The instrument breaks through cartilage and

    stops.



    Quaid pulls the large device from his nose.  The homing device

    glistens like an aluminum pea in a tiny claw at the end of

    the tentacle.



    Quaid takes the bloody pea, rolls it between his thumb and

    forefinger, then shoves it into a Mars bar."

        and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and

        leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen,

        even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.



                                ELLIS' VOICE

                 John, didn't you hear me?



                                MCCLANE

                        (to CB, quietly)

                 Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!



                                ELLIS

                 John, I think you could get with

                 the program a little.  The police

                 are here now.  It's their problem.

                 Tell these guys where the detonators

                 are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey,

                 I'm putting my life on the line for

                 you buddy...



                                MCCLANE

                 Don't you think I know that!  Put

                 Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that

                 shithead doesn't know what kind of

                 scum you are, but I do --



                                HANS

                 Good.  Then you'll give us what we

                 want and save your friend's life.

                 You're not part of this equation.

                 It's time to realize that.



        Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling.

        Ellis smiles, too.



                                ELLIS

                 What am I, a method actor?  Hans,

                 babe, put away the gun.  This is

                 radio, not television...



                                MCCLANE

                 That asshole's not my friend!

                 I barely know him!  I hate his

                 fucking guts --

                        (desperately sincere)

                 -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell

                 him you don't mean shit to me --



                                ELLIS

                 John, how can you say that, after

                 all these years--?  John?  John?



        Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, ""Well, I tried..."" Hans nods

        understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and

        in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to

        Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER.

        Something catches his eye.  He turns, looks at:



347     VIEW THROUGH WINDOW -- HIS P.O.V.                     347



        Through the glass here he can catch a glimpse of the hostages

        coming back into the room!

        McClane herds the last of the hostages inside, starts for the

        door himself, when with a ROAR and a CHATTER of rotors, the

        lead chopper zooms overhead!  McClane throws himself down on the

        ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then

        from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked, McClane DIVES out

        of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door.



349     HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)          349



        descending, SCREAMING and HOWLING as a chopper SWEEPS past a

        They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see

        a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP

        behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose,

        unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs.

        He looks over the edge, hesitates:



                                MCCLANE

                 Fuck this...

        

        Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS:

        Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button.

        STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT in

        the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it

        CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building!



357     MCCLANE                                               357



        Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces

        as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him.



358     THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE                          358

        DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against the

        side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.  The

        shatterproof glass doesn't budge!  Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS

        sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun, KICKS off from the

        building, SWINGS back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his

        arc -- FIRES the gun and sails back in:



360     INSIDE THE BUILDING                                   360



        McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside, rolls

        onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.  Finally

        he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to one knee:



361     UP ON THE ROOF                                        361



        The fire hose mounting is BLASTED off the roof, SAILS past the

        CAMERA:



362     OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                  362



        The hose mechanism tumbles downward!

        It SLIDES down the side of the building!  The hose PLAYS OUT

        on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his death!



365     MCCLANE                                               365



        CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered window,

        he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the

        weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.  Only his

        already wounded foot keeps him indoors.



        He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free

        just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the great beyond!



        Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in time

        for:

        recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is

        momentarily amazed to HEAR a ""ding"" from the elevator -- he looks

        at:

        where suddenly the WALL EXPLODES OUTWARD as an ENTIRE ELEVATOR

        CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL, swinging on its cable like a

        demolition ball on a crane!

374     THE VAULT FLOOR BALCONY                               374



        and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and beneath

        him!  With his last effort, he hauls himself onto the balcony

        and them moves off!

McClane is driven to the Nakatomi Plaza building for a company Christmas party by Argyle.
While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed group: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James.
The group seize the tower and secure those inside as hostages except for McClane, who manages to slip away armed only with a Beretta 92 service pistol.

While checking the explosives attached to the roof, Gruber is confronted by McClane.
Gruber passes himself off as an escaped hostage and is given a gun by McClane.
Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds that the gun is unloaded.
Before McClane can act, Karl, Franco, and Fritz arrive.
McClane kills Fritz and Franco, but is forced to flee, leaving the detonators behind.

FBI agents arrive and take command of the police situation outside, ordering the building's power be shut off.
The power loss disables the vault's final lock as Gruber had anticipated.
Gruber demands that a helicopter arrive on the roof for transport—his intention is to detonate the explosives on the roof to kill the hostages and to fake the deaths of his men and himself.
Karl finds McClane and the two fight.
Meanwhile Gruber views a news report by Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children, causing Gruber to realize that McClane is Holly's husband.
The terrorists order the hostages to the roof, but Gruber takes Holly with him to use against McClane.
McClane seemingly kills Karl and heads to the roof.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:","On Christmas Eve, New York City Police officer John McClane arrives in Los Angeles to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly Gennero.
McClane is driven to the Nakatomi Plaza building for a company Christmas party by Argyle.
While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed group: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James.
The group seize the tower and secure those inside as hostages except for McClane, who manages to slip away armed only with a Beretta 92 service pistol.

Gruber singles out Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi claiming he intends to teach the Corporation a lesson for its greed.
Away from the other hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault as McClane secretly observes.
Gruber admits that they are using terrorism as a distraction while they attempt to steal $640 million in bearer bonds in the vault.
Takagi refuses to cooperate and is executed by Gruber.
McClane accidentally gives himself away and is pursued by Tony.
McClane manages to kill Tony, taking his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the Los Angeles Police Department.
Sgt.
Al Powell is sent to investigate.
Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, but McClane manages to kill both.
Powell, finding nothing strange about the building, attempts to leave, but McClane drops Marco's corpse onto Powell's car, alerting the LAPD who surround the building.
McClane takes Heinrich's bag containing C-4 explosives and detonators.

A SWAT team assaults the building with an unarmed M8 Greyhound armored car but the attack is anticipated, and James and Alexander destroy the car and massacre the SWAT team with rockets.
McClane uses the C-4 to blow up the building floor occupied by James and Alexander, killing them both.
Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson tells McClane to stay out of this, but only ends up getting punned at by McClane.
Holly's coworker Harry Ellis attempts to mediate between Hans and McClane for the return of the detonators.
McClane refuses to return them, causing Gruber to execute Ellis.
While checking the explosives attached to the roof, Gruber is confronted by McClane.
Gruber passes himself off as an escaped hostage and is given a gun by McClane.
Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds that the gun is unloaded.
Before McClane can act, Karl, Franco, and Fritz arrive.
McClane kills Fritz and Franco, but is forced to flee, leaving the detonators behind.

FBI agents arrive and take command of the police situation outside, ordering the building's power be shut off.
The power loss disables the vault's final lock as Gruber had anticipated.
Gruber demands that a helicopter arrive on the roof for transport—his intention is to detonate the explosives on the roof to kill the hostages and to fake the deaths of his men and himself.
Karl finds McClane and the two fight.
Meanwhile Gruber views a news report by Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children, causing Gruber to realize that McClane is Holly's husband.
The terrorists order the hostages to the roof, but Gruber takes Holly with him to use against McClane.
McClane seemingly kills Karl and heads to the roof.
He kills Uli and sends the hostages back downstairs before the explosives detonate, destroying the roof and the FBI helicopter.

Theo goes to the parking garage to retrieve their getaway vehicle but is knocked unconscious by Argyle who had been trapped in the garage during the siege.
A weary McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining men and knocks Kristoff unconscious.
McClane surrenders his machine gun to spare Holly, but then distracts Gruber and Eddie by laughing, allowing him to grab a concealed handgun taped to his back.
McClane shoots Gruber in the shoulder and then kills Eddie.
Gruber is sent crashing through a window but prevents himself from falling by holding onto Holly by her watch.
McClane manages to release the watch and Gruber falls to his death on the street below.

McClane and Holly are escorted from the building and meet Powell in person.
Karl emerges from the building disguised as a hostage and attempts to shoot McClane, but he is gunned down by Powell.
Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo.
Thornburg arrives and attempts to interview McClane, but is punched by Holly for interviewing her kids earlier.
McClane and Holly are driven away by Argyle to their home.","393     EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT                             393



        The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the

        window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto

        Holly as Hans drags her out!



        McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to

        pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with

        her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins

        to INCH towards Holly's wristband.



394     HANS' HAND - WIDEN                                    394



        A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood

        flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand

        to bring up the gun he is still holding!



395     MCCLANE                                               395



        Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one

        last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:



396     VERY CLOSE                                            396



        McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed

        metal SNAPS, links flying:



397     WIDER                                                 397



        Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch

        suddenly drop.



        We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.



        McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.



                                MCCLANE

                 It's okay, babe.  It's okay.



        He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband

        he's still holding.



                                MCCLANE

                 You got a warranty on this?



        She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.

        TILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET.  He is clenching and

        unclenching his toes.



                                 MCCLANE

                         (surprised, actually feeling

                         tension decline)

                  Son-of-a-bitch.  It works.



         Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie

         shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.



                                 HOLLY

                  What are you doing?



                                 MCCLANE

                  It's a long story.  You know, I

                  think that Ellis has his eye on you.



                                 HOLLY

                  That's okay...

                         (pause)

                  ... I have an eye on his private

                  bathroom.



         McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not

         to show any).

                                                                      *



                                 HOLLY

                  So, where are you staying?  This                    *

                  all happened so fast I didn't even

                  ask you on the phone.



         McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.



                                 MCCLANE

                  Well, Cappy Roberts retired out

                  here a couple years ago.  He said I

                  could bunk with him.



                                 HOLLY

                  Oh...Where does he live?



                                 MCCLANE

                  Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.



                                 HOLLY

                  Pomona!  You'll be in the car the

                  whole time...Look, let's make this

                  easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's

                  not huge, but the kids would love to

                  have you at the house.



         McClane fixes her with a look.



                                 MCCLANE

                  They would, huh?



                                 HOLLY

                        (beat; honest)

                  I would too.

                                                                      *

         They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that

         says a lot about how they still feel about each other.



         Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the

         door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty

         retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly

         tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.



                                 HOLLY

                  ...I've missed you.                                 *

                  Especially my name.  You must miss

                  it every time you write a check.  When

                  did you start calling yourself

                  'Ms. Gennero'?



                                 HOLLY

                        (caught)

                  This is a Japanese company, you know?

                  They figure a married woman, she's on

                  the way out the door...



                                 MCCLANE

                  Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember

                  this one particular married woman,

                  she went out the door so fast there

                  was practically a jetwash...I mean,

                  talk about your wind chill factor...



                                 HOLLY

                  Didn't we have this same conversation

                  in July?  Damn it, John, there was

                  an opportunity out here -- I had to

                  take it --



                                 MCCLANE

                  No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?



                                 HOLLY

                  My job and my title and my salary did

                  nothing to our marriage except change

                  your idea of what it should be.



                                 MCCLANE

                  Oh, here it comes.  One of those

                  'meaningful relationship conversations.'

                  I never should've let you get those

                  magazine subscriptions --



                                 HOLLY

                  You want to know my idea of a marriage?

                  It's a partnership where people help

                  each other over the rough spots --

                  console each other when there's a

                  down...and when there's an up, well,

                  hell, a little Goddamn applause or

                  an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.

                        (quietly)

                  I needed that, John.

                        (pause)

                  I deserved that.



         There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to

         say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.  Just then

         the door opens and Ginny leans inside.



                                 GINNY

                  Miz Gennero?  Mr. Takagi is looking

                  for you...he wants you to say something

                  to the troops...



                                 HOLLY

                  Thanks, Ginny.  I'll be a second.

                  sensitive and supportive man of the

         Ginny looks puzzled, goes out.  Holly sighs, moves to the

         door.



                                 HOLLY

5604,Die Hard,"375     EXT. BUILDING                                         375



        The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are

        open-mouthed.



376     IN THE BASEMENT                                       376



        Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed

        animal held over his head as much for company as protection.

        As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from

        under the fur...and sees:



377     HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                     377



        at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's

        jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the

        truck away from the loading dock.



378     MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                          378



        He creeps forward, looks carefully into:



379     HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                               379



        They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly

        the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.



380     BACK TO SCENE                                         380



        McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took

        from Uli.  One bullet!



                                MCCLANE

                        (under his breath)

                 Shit...



        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.

        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to

        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.

        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a

        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:



380-A   IN THE BASEMENT                                       380-A



        Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into

        the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.



381     ARGYLE                                                381



        Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.



382     THE GARAGE                                            382



        A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier

        delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into

        the van, which CAREENS into the wall.



383     CLOSER                                                383



        Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.

                 Let's move.



        The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while

        Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the

        door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a

        rifle butt.



385     WIDER                                                 385



        McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still

        tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun

        ready.



                                MCCLANE

                 Hans!



        Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into

        view.  No words need be said.



                                HOLLY

                 John!



                                MCCLANE

                 Holly, we have to stop meeting like

                 this.

                        (taking in the vault)

                 So that's what it was.  A fucking

                 robbery.

                        (thinking)

                 So why nuke the building, Hans?



                                HANS

                        (with a shrug)

                 When you steal six hundred dollars,

                 you can disappear...but when you

                 steal six hundred million, they will

                 find you...unless you play dead.

                        (tight smile)

                 Which happens to be your next role...

                 drop your gun, please.



        McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,

        really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.



                                HANS

                        (to Eddie)

                 Nein, dies ein ist mein.

                        (to McClane)

                 off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

                 That was Gary Cooper, shithead...



                                HANS

                 No more jokes, drop it or she gets it

                 between the eyes!



                                MCCLANE

                        (slowly putting down

                        his gun)

                 Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?



                                HANS

                 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now

                 you are fucked.



        He aims:



                                MCCLANE

                 Holly, now...!



        Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!



386     MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                          386



        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta

        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS

        Hans high in the chest!



        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind

        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is

        happening, McClane SPINS:



387     EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS             387



        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.



388     BACK TO SCENE                                         388



        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood

        in shock.



389     MCCLANE                                               389



                                MCCLANE

                 You were right about us Americans.

                        from his pistol

        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and

        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to

        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward

        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:



391     HOLLY'S WRIST                                         391

        Hans straightens, looks hard at Takagi.

        Takagi looks confused.  Hans puts a friendly arm around Takagi's

        shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where

        Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer console.

                  industrialization of men's fashions

                  all day, but I'm afraid my associate,

                  Mr. Theo, has some questions for you.

                  Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions

        Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has

        just read the screen, blurts:

        Takagi complies.  Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet.

                  Yes...I know about them.  The code

                  key is a necessary step in accessing

                  the vault.

        Hans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer.  He feels

        his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips it

        back into his coat pocket.



                                 HANS

                  safeguards on our vault, and the

                  code key is only one of them!  You'll

                  never get it open!



        Hans lifts the gun.

McClane is driven to the Nakatomi Plaza building for a company Christmas party by Argyle.
While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed group: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James.
The group seize the tower and secure those inside as hostages except for McClane, who manages to slip away armed only with a Beretta 92 service pistol.

Gruber singles out Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi claiming he intends to teach the Corporation a lesson for its greed.
Away from the other hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault as McClane secretly observes.
Gruber admits that they are using terrorism as a distraction while they attempt to steal $640 million in bearer bonds in the vault.
Takagi refuses to cooperate and is executed by Gruber.
McClane accidentally gives himself away and is pursued by Tony.
McClane manages to kill Tony, taking his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the Los Angeles Police Department.
Sgt.
Al Powell is sent to investigate.
Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, but McClane manages to kill both.
Powell, finding nothing strange about the building, attempts to leave, but McClane drops Marco's corpse onto Powell's car, alerting the LAPD who surround the building.
McClane takes Heinrich's bag containing C-4 explosives and detonators.

A SWAT team assaults the building with an unarmed M8 Greyhound armored car but the attack is anticipated, and James and Alexander destroy the car and massacre the SWAT team with rockets.
McClane uses the C-4 to blow up the building floor occupied by James and Alexander, killing them both.
Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson tells McClane to stay out of this, but only ends up getting punned at by McClane.
Holly's coworker Harry Ellis attempts to mediate between Hans and McClane for the return of the detonators.
McClane refuses to return them, causing Gruber to execute Ellis.
While checking the explosives attached to the roof, Gruber is confronted by McClane.
Gruber passes himself off as an escaped hostage and is given a gun by McClane.
Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds that the gun is unloaded.
Before McClane can act, Karl, Franco, and Fritz arrive.
McClane kills Fritz and Franco, but is forced to flee, leaving the detonators behind.

FBI agents arrive and take command of the police situation outside, ordering the building's power be shut off.
The power loss disables the vault's final lock as Gruber had anticipated.
Gruber demands that a helicopter arrive on the roof for transport—his intention is to detonate the explosives on the roof to kill the hostages and to fake the deaths of his men and himself.
Karl finds McClane and the two fight.
Meanwhile Gruber views a news report by Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children, causing Gruber to realize that McClane is Holly's husband.
The terrorists order the hostages to the roof, but Gruber takes Holly with him to use against McClane.
McClane seemingly kills Karl and heads to the roof.
He kills Uli and sends the hostages back downstairs before the explosives detonate, destroying the roof and the FBI helicopter.

Theo goes to the parking garage to retrieve their getaway vehicle but is knocked unconscious by Argyle who had been trapped in the garage during the siege.
A weary McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining men and knocks Kristoff unconscious.
McClane surrenders his machine gun to spare Holly, but then distracts Gruber and Eddie by laughing, allowing him to grab a concealed handgun taped to his back.
McClane shoots Gruber in the shoulder and then kills Eddie.
Gruber is sent crashing through a window but prevents himself from falling by holding onto Holly by her watch.
McClane manages to release the watch and Gruber falls to his death on the street below.

McClane and Holly are escorted from the building and meet Powell in person.
Karl emerges from the building disguised as a hostage and attempts to shoot McClane, but he is gunned down by Powell.
Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo.
Thornburg arrives and attempts to interview McClane, but is punched by Holly for interviewing her kids earlier.
McClane and Holly are driven away by Argyle to their home.","CONFERENCE ROOM - BOARD ROOM FLOOR - NIGHT        63

        the terrorist ""office"".  Immediately the chief guard here,

        Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis.



                                HOLLY

                 Where are you going?



                                ELLIS

                 I'm tired of sitting here waiting

                 to see who gets us killed first...

                 them...or your husband.

                        (to the approaching

                        Fritz)

                 Hi there.



                                HOLLY

                        (worried)

                 What are you going to do?



                                ELLIS

                 Hey, I negotiate million dollar

                 deals for breakfast.  I can handle

                 these clowns.

                        (to Fritz)

                 I want to talk to Hans.  Hans!

                 Sprickenzie talk?



        He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly

        worries.



230     THE OFFICE                                           230



                                KARL

                        (in mid-speech,

                        angry)

                 -- you wouldn't let me kill him

                 when I had the chance --



                                HANS

                 If you'd listened to me he would

                 be neutralized already!



                                KARL

                 I don't want neutral...I want dead --



        ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.



                                ELLIS

                 Hope I'm not interrupting...?



                                HANS

                        (to Fritz)

                 What does he want?



        As Fritz shrugs:



                                ELLIS

                 It's not what I want, it's what

                 I can give you.  Look, let's be

                 straight, okay?  It's obvious

                 you're not some dumb thug up

                 here to snatch a few purses, am

                 I right?



        Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug

        this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious

        or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.



                                HANS

                        (politely)

                 You're very perceptive.



                                ELLIS

                        (flattered)

                 Hey, I read the papers, I watch

                 60 minutes, I say to myself, these

                 guys are professionals, they're

                 motivated, they're happening.

                 They want something.  Now, personally,

                 I don't care about your politics.

                 Maybe you're pissed at the

                 Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the

                 Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's

                 none of my business.  I figure,

                 You're here to negotiate, am I right?



                                HANS

                 You're amazing.  You figured this

                 all out already?



                                ELLIS

                 Hey, business is business.  You use

                 a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's

                 the difference?  To put it in my

                 terms, you're here on a hostile

                 takeover and you grab us for some

                 greenmail but you didn't expect a

                 poison pill was gonna be running

                 around the building.

                        (smiling)

                 Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.



                                HANS

                        (dryly)

                 I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What

                 are you saying?



                                ELLIS

                 The guy upstairs who's fucking things

                 up?  I can give him to you.



        As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:



                                                    CUT TO:



231     POWELL                                               231



        By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.



                                POWELL

                 Roy!  You all right?



232     INSIDE - MCCLANE                                     232



        He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package

        of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.



                                MCCLANE

                 Yeah, just trying to handle some

                 year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What

                 do they put in these things?



                                POWELL

                        (reciting)

                 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially

                 hydrogenated vegetable oil,

                 polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'



                                MCCLANE

                        (laughing)

                 You sound like a man with a

                 couple of kids.



                                POWELL

                 Not yet, the wife in working on our

                 first.  You got any kids back on

                 the ranch?



        McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet,

        flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids

        in happier days.



                                MCCLANE

                 Two.  And I'd sure like to see them

                 swinging on the jungle gym with

                 Al junior.



                                POWELL

                 It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.



        McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE

        besides Powell's comes over his radio.



                                HANS' VOICE

                        (o.s., on CB)

                 Touching, cowboy, touching.

                        (pause)

                 Or should I call you Mister McClane?

                 Mister officer John McClane on the

                 NYPD?



        McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know?

                                MCCLANE

                        (fighting to stay calm)

                 Sister Teresa in third grade called

                 me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me

                 John Mac.  You're neither...shithead.



                                HANS' VOICE

                 I have someone who wants to talk

                 to you.  A very special friend who

                 was at the party with you tonight.



        McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the

        voice that tells him it's all over.



                                ELLIS' VOICE

                 Hello, John boy?



        McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope.

        In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him

        the CB.



                                MCCLANE

                 Ellis?



        Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.



                                ELLIS

                 John, they're giving me a few minutes

                 to try and talk some sense into you.

                 I know you think you're doing your

                 job, and I can appreciate that, but

                 you're just dragging this thing out.

                 None of us gets out of here until

                 these people can negotiate with the

                 LA police, and they're just not gonna

                 start doing that until you stop

                 messing up the works.



                                MCCLANE

                        (carefully)

                 Ellis, what have you told them?



                                ELLIS

                 I told them we're old friends and you

                 were my guest at the party.



        McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his

        eyes.



                                MCCLANE

                 Ellis...you shouldn't be doing

                 this...



                                ELLIS

                 Tell me about it.



        He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.



                                ELLIS

                 All right...John, listen to me...

                 They want you to tell them where the

                 detonators are.  They know people are

                 listening.  They want the detonators

                 of they're going to kill me.



        Ellis gives Hans a big ""ok"" sign.  Hans returns it.","On Christmas Eve, New York City Police officer John McClane arrives in Los Angeles to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly Gennero.
McClane is driven to the Nakatomi Plaza building for a company Christmas party by Argyle.
While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed group: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James.
The group seize the tower and secure those inside as hostages except for McClane, who manages to slip away armed only with a Beretta 92 service pistol.

Gruber singles out Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi claiming he intends to teach the Corporation a lesson for its greed.
Away from the other hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault as McClane secretly observes.
Gruber admits that they are using terrorism as a distraction while they attempt to steal $640 million in bearer bonds in the vault.
Takagi refuses to cooperate and is executed by Gruber.
McClane accidentally gives himself away and is pursued by Tony.
McClane manages to kill Tony, taking his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the Los Angeles Police Department.
Sgt.
Al Powell is sent to investigate.
Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, but McClane manages to kill both.
Powell, finding nothing strange about the building, attempts to leave, but McClane drops Marco's corpse onto Powell's car, alerting the LAPD who surround the building.
McClane takes Heinrich's bag containing C-4 explosives and detonators.

A SWAT team assaults the building with an unarmed M8 Greyhound armored car but the attack is anticipated, and James and Alexander destroy the car and massacre the SWAT team with rockets.
McClane uses the C-4 to blow up the building floor occupied by James and Alexander, killing them both.
Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson tells McClane to stay out of this, but only ends up getting punned at by McClane.
Holly's coworker Harry Ellis attempts to mediate between Hans and McClane for the return of the detonators.
McClane refuses to return them, causing Gruber to execute Ellis.
While checking the explosives attached to the roof, Gruber is confronted by McClane.
Gruber passes himself off as an escaped hostage and is given a gun by McClane.
Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds that the gun is unloaded.
Before McClane can act, Karl, Franco, and Fritz arrive.
McClane kills Fritz and Franco, but is forced to flee, leaving the detonators behind.

FBI agents arrive and take command of the police situation outside, ordering the building's power be shut off.
The power loss disables the vault's final lock as Gruber had anticipated.
Gruber demands that a helicopter arrive on the roof for transport—his intention is to detonate the explosives on the roof to kill the hostages and to fake the deaths of his men and himself.
Karl finds McClane and the two fight.
Meanwhile Gruber views a news report by Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children, causing Gruber to realize that McClane is Holly's husband.
The terrorists order the hostages to the roof, but Gruber takes Holly with him to use against McClane.
McClane seemingly kills Karl and heads to the roof.
He kills Uli and sends the hostages back downstairs before the explosives detonate, destroying the roof and the FBI helicopter.

Theo goes to the parking garage to retrieve their getaway vehicle but is knocked unconscious by Argyle who had been trapped in the garage during the siege.
A weary McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining men and knocks Kristoff unconscious.
McClane surrenders his machine gun to spare Holly, but then distracts Gruber and Eddie by laughing, allowing him to grab a concealed handgun taped to his back.
McClane shoots Gruber in the shoulder and then kills Eddie.
Gruber is sent crashing through a window but prevents himself from falling by holding onto Holly by her watch.
McClane manages to release the watch and Gruber falls to his death on the street below.

McClane and Holly are escorted from the building and meet Powell in person.
Karl emerges from the building disguised as a hostage and attempts to shoot McClane, but he is gunned down by Powell.
Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo.
Thornburg arrives and attempts to interview McClane, but is punched by Holly for interviewing her kids earlier.
McClane and Holly are driven away by Argyle to their home.","33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                         227

        A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.  We

        SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by

        SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane

        breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into

        the crowd.

        The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and

        There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.

        Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his

        machine gun.","On Christmas Eve, New York City Police officer John McClane arrives in Los Angeles to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly Gennero.
McClane is driven to the Nakatomi Plaza building for a company Christmas party by Argyle.
While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed group: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James.
The group seize the tower and secure those inside as hostages except for McClane, who manages to slip away armed only with a Beretta 92 service pistol.

Gruber singles out Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi claiming he intends to teach the Corporation a lesson for its greed.
Away from the other hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault as McClane secretly observes.
Gruber admits that they are using terrorism as a distraction while they attempt to steal $640 million in bearer bonds in the vault.
Takagi refuses to cooperate and is executed by Gruber.
McClane accidentally gives himself away and is pursued by Tony.
McClane manages to kill Tony, taking his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the Los Angeles Police Department.
Sgt.
Al Powell is sent to investigate.
Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, but McClane manages to kill both.
Powell, finding nothing strange about the building, attempts to leave, but McClane drops Marco's corpse onto Powell's car, alerting the LAPD who surround the building.
McClane takes Heinrich's bag containing C-4 explosives and detonators.

A SWAT team assaults the building with an unarmed M8 Greyhound armored car but the attack is anticipated, and James and Alexander destroy the car and massacre the SWAT team with rockets.
McClane uses the C-4 to blow up the building floor occupied by James and Alexander, killing them both.
Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson tells McClane to stay out of this, but only ends up getting punned at by McClane.
Holly's coworker Harry Ellis attempts to mediate between Hans and McClane for the return of the detonators.
McClane refuses to return them, causing Gruber to execute Ellis.
While checking the explosives attached to the roof, Gruber is confronted by McClane.
Gruber passes himself off as an escaped hostage and is given a gun by McClane.
Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds that the gun is unloaded.
Before McClane can act, Karl, Franco, and Fritz arrive.
McClane kills Fritz and Franco, but is forced to flee, leaving the detonators behind.

FBI agents arrive and take command of the police situation outside, ordering the building's power be shut off.
The power loss disables the vault's final lock as Gruber had anticipated.
Gruber demands that a helicopter arrive on the roof for transport—his intention is to detonate the explosives on the roof to kill the hostages and to fake the deaths of his men and himself.
Karl finds McClane and the two fight.
Meanwhile Gruber views a news report by Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children, causing Gruber to realize that McClane is Holly's husband.
The terrorists order the hostages to the roof, but Gruber takes Holly with him to use against McClane.
McClane seemingly kills Karl and heads to the roof.
He kills Uli and sends the hostages back downstairs before the explosives detonate, destroying the roof and the FBI helicopter.

Theo goes to the parking garage to retrieve their getaway vehicle but is knocked unconscious by Argyle who had been trapped in the garage during the siege.
A weary McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining men and knocks Kristoff unconscious.
McClane surrenders his machine gun to spare Holly, but then distracts Gruber and Eddie by laughing, allowing him to grab a concealed handgun taped to his back.
McClane shoots Gruber in the shoulder and then kills Eddie.
Gruber is sent crashing through a window but prevents himself from falling by holding onto Holly by her watch.
McClane manages to release the watch and Gruber falls to his death on the street below.

McClane and Holly are escorted from the building and meet Powell in person.
Karl emerges from the building disguised as a hostage and attempts to shoot McClane, but he is gunned down by Powell.
Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo.
Thornburg arrives and attempts to interview McClane, but is punched by Holly for interviewing her kids earlier.
McClane and Holly are driven away by Argyle to their home.","BUILDING - DAWN                                  398

        A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open. We

        SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by

        SWAT men. As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane

        breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into

        the crowd. MCCLANE

However, unbeknownst to his daughter and most of his other employees, he has cooked his company's books in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud.
One night, while driving with his mistress Julie Cote (Laetitia Casta), he begins to doze off and crashes; Julie is killed.
An injured Miller leaves the scene and decides to cover up his involvement to prevent the public, his wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon), and the prospective buyer James Mayfield (Graydon Carter) from discovering the truth.

Miller calls Jimmy Grant (Nate Parker), a twenty-three-year-old man from Harlem with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past, and whose father had been Miller's driver for many years.
After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife.
The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer (Tim Roth).
Bryer is keen on arresting Miller for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together.
Brooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.

Jimmy is arrested and placed before a grand jury but still refuses to admit to helping Miller.
Miller once again contemplates turning himself in.
Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good.
Eventually the sale is closed but Miller finds a way to avoid being charged.
He proves that Detective Bryer fabricated evidence.
The case against Jimmy is dismissed and the detective is ordered not to go near him.
Miller's wife tries to blackmail him with a separation agreement getting rid of his wealth.
When Robert Miller refuses to sign, his wife says that she will tell the police that he got into bed at 4:30 am on the night of the accident, bruised and bleeding.

In the final scene, Miller addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter.
It is kept deliberately ambiguous whether he gave in to his wife's blackmail or she had backed off; in any case, his financial and personal misdeeds were clearly kept out of the public gaze.

An injured Miller leaves the scene and decides to cover up his involvement to prevent the public, his wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon), and the prospective buyer James Mayfield (Graydon Carter) from discovering the truth.

Miller calls Jimmy Grant (Nate Parker), a twenty-three-year-old man from Harlem with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past, and whose father had been Miller's driver for many years.
After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife.
The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer (Tim Roth).
Bryer is keen on arresting Miller for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together.
Brooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.

Jimmy is arrested and placed before a grand jury but still refuses to admit to helping Miller.
Miller once again contemplates turning himself in.
Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good.
Eventually the sale is closed but Miller finds a way to avoid being charged.
He proves that Detective Bryer fabricated evidence.
The case against Jimmy is dismissed and the detective is ordered not to go near him.
Miller's wife tries to blackmail him with a separation agreement getting rid of his wealth.
When Robert Miller refuses to sign, his wife says that she will tell the police that he got into bed at 4:30 am on the night of the accident, bruised and bleeding.

In the final scene, Miller addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter.
It is kept deliberately ambiguous whether he gave in to his wife's blackmail or she had backed off; in any case, his financial and personal misdeeds were clearly kept out of the public gaze.

          ""Mt. Sinai Hospital - Miller Oncology Center.""","Sixty-year-old magnate Robert Miller manages a hedge fund with his daughter Brooke (Brit Marling) and is about to sell it for a handsome profit.
However, unbeknownst to his daughter and most of his other employees, he has cooked his company's books in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud.
One night, while driving with his mistress Julie Cote (Laetitia Casta), he begins to doze off and crashes; Julie is killed.
An injured Miller leaves the scene and decides to cover up his involvement to prevent the public, his wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon), and the prospective buyer James Mayfield (Graydon Carter) from discovering the truth.

Miller calls Jimmy Grant (Nate Parker), a twenty-three-year-old man from Harlem with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past, and whose father had been Miller's driver for many years.
After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife.
The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer (Tim Roth).
Bryer is keen on arresting Miller for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together.
Brooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.

Jimmy is arrested and placed before a grand jury but still refuses to admit to helping Miller.
Miller once again contemplates turning himself in.
Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good.
Eventually the sale is closed but Miller finds a way to avoid being charged.
He proves that Detective Bryer fabricated evidence.
The case against Jimmy is dismissed and the detective is ordered not to go near him.
Miller's wife tries to blackmail him with a separation agreement getting rid of his wealth.
When Robert Miller refuses to sign, his wife says that she will tell the police that he got into bed at 4:30 am on the night of the accident, bruised and bleeding.

In the final scene, Miller addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter.
It is kept deliberately ambiguous whether he gave in to his wife's blackmail or she had backed off; in any case, his financial and personal misdeeds were clearly kept out of the public gaze.

          As Brooke exits, she and Bryer cross paths. She eyes him...

          He doesn't look familiar. Off Brooke, curious.","Sixty-year-old magnate Robert Miller manages a hedge fund with his daughter Brooke (Brit Marling) and is about to sell it for a handsome profit.
However, unbeknownst to his daughter and most of his other employees, he has cooked his company's books in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud.
One night, while driving with his mistress Julie Cote (Laetitia Casta), he begins to doze off and crashes; Julie is killed.
An injured Miller leaves the scene and decides to cover up his involvement to prevent the public, his wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon), and the prospective buyer James Mayfield (Graydon Carter) from discovering the truth.

Miller calls Jimmy Grant (Nate Parker), a twenty-three-year-old man from Harlem with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past, and whose father had been Miller's driver for many years.
After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife.
The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer (Tim Roth).
Bryer is keen on arresting Miller for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together.
Brooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.

Jimmy is arrested and placed before a grand jury but still refuses to admit to helping Miller.
Miller once again contemplates turning himself in.
Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good.
Eventually the sale is closed but Miller finds a way to avoid being charged.
He proves that Detective Bryer fabricated evidence.
The case against Jimmy is dismissed and the detective is ordered not to go near him.
Miller's wife tries to blackmail him with a separation agreement getting rid of his wealth.
When Robert Miller refuses to sign, his wife says that she will tell the police that he got into bed at 4:30 am on the night of the accident, bruised and bleeding.

In the final scene, Miller addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter.
It is kept deliberately ambiguous whether he gave in to his wife's blackmail or she had backed off; in any case, his financial and personal misdeeds were clearly kept out of the public gaze.

Sam oversees automated harvesters and launches canisters bound for Earth, containing the helium-3 they have extracted.
Chronic communication problems limit him to occasional recorded messages to his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left.
His only companion is an artificial intelligence named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation.

Two weeks before he is to return to Earth, Sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl.
One such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his rover into the harvester.
Rapidly losing air, Sam puts on his helmet, but loses consciousness.

Sam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident.
He overhears GERTY receiving instructions from Lunar Industries not to let him outside the base and to wait for the arrival of rescue team ""Eliza"".
His suspicions aroused, he manufactures a fake problem to force GERTY to let him outside.
He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds an older Sam Bell, unconscious.

He brings Old Sam back to the base and tends to his injuries.
The two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other.
After a heated argument and physical altercation, they together coerce GERTY into revealing that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell.
GERTY activated New Sam after the rover crash and implanted the memories of the original Sam Bell.

The two Sams begin searching the base, finding live communications jammed by transmitters located beyond the outermost perimeter of the base.
They also discover that four previous clones all started to physically deteriorate three years after awakening.
Told they would hibernate briefly for the journey home, they were actually incinerated after being put to sleep.

The two newest clones also find many more unconscious doubles in a secret hidden vault below the main level.
Old Sam drives past the interference radius in a second rover and calls Tess on Earth.
However, he instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died ""some years ago"".
He hangs up when he hears her father, original Sam, talking in the background and coming toward the screen.

The two Sams realize that the incoming Eliza ""rescue"" team will kill them both if they are found together.
New Sam suggests sending the other to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports, but Old Sam, already badly deteriorated, knows that he will not live much longer.
He suggests New Sam leave instead, and alert the public to Lunar Industries' unethical practices.
Old Sam plans to die by the crashed rover so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything until it is too late.

New Sam orders GERTY to revive a seventh clone to greet the rescuers, then programs a harvester to crash and wreck a jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth.
On the advice of GERTY—and to prevent the ELIZA team from discovering their plan by examining its memory archives—New Sam then reboots GERTY, erasing its records of the event.
Old Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the ship carrying New Sam to Earth.

As the credits roll, the helium transport is depicted entering Earth's upper atmosphere, while news reports describe how ""a Sam Bell clone's"" testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, with the company's shares dipping by a significant margin.","48   INT.

     that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.



     Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with

     CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens

     the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.



     ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam

     takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the

     THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER



     The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the

     accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles

     of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is

     an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped

     inside.



     Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his

     body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching

     for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.



     With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door

     open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.



     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,

     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam

     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and

     turns the unconscious man onto his back.

     down even closer.

     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as

     we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of

     just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.

                     SAM 2

           I've been thinking. That Rescue

           Unit -- Eliza -- they'll be here

           in less than fourteen hours. I

           don't know about you but I'd like

           to figure out where we stand

           before they get here.



                     SAM 1

           Absolutely.



                      SAM 2

           Ostensibly they're coming to deal

           with the stalled harvester. We

           both know that isn't true.

               (then)

           They're coming to dig your body

           out of that rover. They think

           you're in there.



                        SAM 1

           Right.



                     SAM 2

           What'll their reaction be when

           they find out you survived the

           crash? I wasn't supposed to find

           you. Lunar instructed Gerty to

           lock me inside the base for

           Christ's sake.



A pause. Sam 1 thinking it over.



                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)

           And there's something else.

           Something I haven't told you.

               (a beat)

                     (MORE)



                                                                    58.



                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)

           Right around the time I was

           awakened...I walked in on Gerty

           talking to Central. He was having

           a live conversation.



                     SAM 1

           A live conversation?



                      SAM 2

           Yeah.



                     SAM 1

           That's not possible.



                     SAM 2

           No no no, it is possible. It's

           possible because I saw it, that's

           my point.



Sam 2 feels himself losing his temper a little here. He

reigns himself in.



                     SAM 1

           How do you know the conversation

           was live?



                     SAM 2

           It was a back and forth exchange.

           And I saw Thompson and Overmeyers

           up on the monitor. I was supposed

           to be asleep in the Infirmary.

           The moment I walked into the

           comms room Gerty terminated the

           transmission. Now I was a little

           drugged up, granted, but I didn't

           imagine it.



                     SAM 1

           The communications equipment is

           damaged -- there was a solar

           storm --



                      SAM 2

           Tabitha.



                     SAM 1

           Tabitha, right.



                     SAM 2

           Lunar made it up. Maybe. I don't

           know. Bottom line is they don't

           want us to be able to contact

           Earth. Otherwise why would they

           have lied to us?



A pause. Sam 1 staring forward, concentrating. Sam 2

concentrating on Sam 1.



                                                                           59.







                           SAM 1

                 How are they blocking the live

                 feed? The base's communications

                 equipment works fine --



                           SAM 2

                 Maybe they're not blocking the

                 signal from inside the base.



                           SAM 1

                 From where then?



      As if reading each others minds, the two Sams' heads turn

      to the window -- a slow, perfectly synchronized movement.



      The lunar landscape, as black and vast as ever. The view

      almost cruel in its emptiness. It's not giving them any

      answers, not yet.



                                                        CUT TO:

      Sam 1 speeding along in one of the Rovers. He wears his

      space suit and resembles a cosmic racing driver -- shifts

      up a gear, the vehicle flirting with peak speed.



      He flies past one of the Harvesters, speaks through a

      microphone inside his helmet.



                           SAM 1

                 Just passing the last of the

                 Harvesters -- looks like John --



      All of this against the ROAR of the Rover's engine.





104   I/E. ROVER TWO/MOON SURFACE                                   104



      Driving away from base in a   different direction, Sam 2. He

      also wears a space suit. He   also guns the engine. He also

      has a microphone inside his   helmet. The two clones are able

      to talk back and forth with   no delay.



                           SAM 2

                 How long until you're out of the

                 base's range?



      We INTERCUT between the two Sams in their Rovers.



                           SAM 1

                 If I maintain this speed...a

                 minute. Ninety seconds tops.



                           SAM 2

                 You ever been this far out?



                                                                         60.







                              SAM 1

                 No, never.





      ANOTHER ANGLE -- SECOND ROVER



      Viewed from far away, the Rover's speed less impressive

      from a distance.





105   I/E. ROVER'S ONE AND TWO/MOON SURFACE -- INTERCUT           105



      As the Sams continue to drive.



                           SAM 1

                 You see anything yet?



                           SAM 2

                 Nothing. You?



                            SAM 1

                 There isn't shit out here...I

                 feel like I'm about to drive off

                 the end of the world.

                     (then)

                 It would help if I knew what I

                 was looking for.



      Through the glass of Sam 1's helmet we see his FACE

      suddenly SHIFT.



                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                 Wait a second, wait a second.



      Sam 1 squints and leans closer towards the windshield, like

      he's trying to decipher a road sign --



                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                 I see something.





      SAM 1'S POV



      About a hundred feet away -- appearing from thin air -- a

      massive metal pole stretches up into the black sky.



                           SAM 2

                 What is it?



                           SAM 1

                 Don't know yet.



      Sam 1 getting closer.



                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)

                 Looks like some kind of antenna.



                                                                  61.







                      SAM 2

           Antenna? Really?

               (then)

           Hang on, looks like there's one

           on this side too.



Sam 2 is indeed approaching something similar.



Sam 1 stops his Rover about twenty feet from the Jammer. He

opens the Rover's door and steps out to take a closer look.





WIDE SHOT -- SAM 1/ROVER



Taking in the Jammer and the adjacent Rover. Sam 1 loping

towards the Jammer, seemingly in slow motion.



The JAMMER is GIGANTIC --An intimidating, stark pole

stabbed into the lunar landscape, like the worlds biggest

caber. Next to it Sam 1 is tiny, a white dot, as

insignificant as a pin prick.



Sam 1 and Sam 2



We cut back and forth between the two Sams as they both

investigate the separate but identical-looking Jammers.



                      SAM 2 (CONT'D)

           I can just make out the top. Must

           be a hundred feet tall at least.

           It's huge!



                     SAM 1

           Whoever built these things meant

           business. They weren't fucking

           around.



Their voices ENERGIZED -- they are excited to have made

this discovery -- they aren't dealing with the negatives

yet.



                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)

           What do you think?



                     SAM 2

           Its not an antennae, dude. Its a

           jammer.

               (looking around)

           No wonder we can't get a live

           feed. These things must be

           blocking our signal.



Suddenly Sam 1 doubles over. He vomits thick, viscous

blood and sick into his helmet. Revolting.



The noise is AUDIBLE over the microphone.



                                                                         62.







                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                  You okay?



      No answer from Sam 1. He COLLAPSES backwards onto the

      ground. His chest LURCHES like he's been punched at from

      the inside -- he spins over onto his front --



                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                  Sam?



      Sam 1 manages to climb to his feet -- heads slowly back to

      the Rover -- he dips in, closes the door.



                            SAM 2 (CONT'D)

                  Sam, can you hear me?



                             SAM 1

                  Yeah, I hear you.

                      (then)

                  I'm going to head back to base.

                  I'm not feeling too good.



                            SAM 2

                  I'll stay out here a little

                  longer. I want to see if there

                  are any more of these things.



      Sam 1 pulls a U-turn and begins his journey back to base.



      Sam 2 remains out by his Jammer, investigating further.



                                                      CUT TO:

      Sam 1 at the wheel. He has pulled his helmet off within

      the safe pocket of the rovers cabin. He's a grizzly mess

      of splashed sick and blood all over his face and chest.



      Sam 1 screams out with confusion, frustration, terror.



                              SAM 1

                  Fuck!

      beginning to really LOSE IT --","Sam Bell nears the end of a three-year work contract as the sole resident at Lunar Industries' largely automated lunar mining base ""Sarang"".
Sam oversees automated harvesters and launches canisters bound for Earth, containing the helium-3 they have extracted.
Chronic communication problems limit him to occasional recorded messages to his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left.
His only companion is an artificial intelligence named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation.

Two weeks before he is to return to Earth, Sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl.
One such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his rover into the harvester.
Rapidly losing air, Sam puts on his helmet, but loses consciousness.

Sam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident.
He overhears GERTY receiving instructions from Lunar Industries not to let him outside the base and to wait for the arrival of rescue team ""Eliza"".
His suspicions aroused, he manufactures a fake problem to force GERTY to let him outside.
He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds an older Sam Bell, unconscious.

He brings Old Sam back to the base and tends to his injuries.
The two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other.
After a heated argument and physical altercation, they together coerce GERTY into revealing that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell.
GERTY activated New Sam after the rover crash and implanted the memories of the original Sam Bell.

The two Sams begin searching the base, finding live communications jammed by transmitters located beyond the outermost perimeter of the base.
They also discover that four previous clones all started to physically deteriorate three years after awakening.
Told they would hibernate briefly for the journey home, they were actually incinerated after being put to sleep.

The two newest clones also find many more unconscious doubles in a secret hidden vault below the main level.
Old Sam drives past the interference radius in a second rover and calls Tess on Earth.
However, he instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died ""some years ago"".
He hangs up when he hears her father, original Sam, talking in the background and coming toward the screen.

The two Sams realize that the incoming Eliza ""rescue"" team will kill them both if they are found together.
New Sam suggests sending the other to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports, but Old Sam, already badly deteriorated, knows that he will not live much longer.
He suggests New Sam leave instead, and alert the public to Lunar Industries' unethical practices.
Old Sam plans to die by the crashed rover so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything until it is too late.

New Sam orders GERTY to revive a seventh clone to greet the rescuers, then programs a harvester to crash and wreck a jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth.
On the advice of GERTY—and to prevent the ELIZA team from discovering their plan by examining its memory archives—New Sam then reboots GERTY, erasing its records of the event.
Old Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the ship carrying New Sam to Earth.

As the credits roll, the helium transport is depicted entering Earth's upper atmosphere, while news reports describe how ""a Sam Bell clone's"" testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, with the company's shares dipping by a significant margin.","REC ROOM   -- LATER                                      102

                 Gerty, looks like we've got a

                 live one out on Matthew. I

                 wondered what was taking him so

                 long, the old fart. I'm heading

                 out in a few minutes, just going

                 to finish my coffee.



                              GERTY'S VOICE

                 Okay, Sam.



                                                     CUT TO:





50   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MORNING                            50



     Sam at the wheel in his space suit, speeding towards the

     first of the Harvesters, known as MATTHEW.





     HARVESTER/MATTHEW



     As Sam gets closer to the Harvester, he suddenly sees

     something:



     The Girl.



     She is standing maybe a hundred yards away in her yellow

     dress, resembling a FLAME or a FLOWER in the barren and

     colorless landscape. She appears to be staring directly at

     Sam's rover.





     SAM



     His face unfolding with panic, alarm, curiosity. An

     intense, yearning, curiosity.



                                                                       25.







     He drives closer.



     But like in a dream, Sam can't seem to make up any distance

     between the Rover and the Girl. He CRUSHES the accelerator

     peddle.



     For a moment Sam drives right alongside the Harvester,

     clouds of lunar dust being kicked up, cascading against the

     side window. But Sam is looking away from the Harvester,

     focussed on the Girl.



     ON SAM: He doesn't notice Matthew (The Harvester) suddenly

     veer RIGHT, slamming into the side of the Rover and causing

     Sam to lose control.



     The steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately

     tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle, but a split

     second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox, and SPUN

     into the path of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS SCREECH of

     MANGLED METAL -- the Rover gobbled up by the front of the

     Harvester, DEVOURED.



     The Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester's monstrous AXLE,

     resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG,

     BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL.



     WIDE SHOT: Silence. The Harvester stationary. The Rover

     caught beneath it.



     No sign of the Girl.



                                                     CUT TO:





     BLACK.

     It's the Infirmary.","Sam Bell nears the end of a three-year work contract as the sole resident at Lunar Industries' largely automated lunar mining base ""Sarang"".
Sam oversees automated harvesters and launches canisters bound for Earth, containing the helium-3 they have extracted.
Chronic communication problems limit him to occasional recorded messages to his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left.
His only companion is an artificial intelligence named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation.

Two weeks before he is to return to Earth, Sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl.
One such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his rover into the harvester.
Rapidly losing air, Sam puts on his helmet, but loses consciousness.

Sam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident.
He overhears GERTY receiving instructions from Lunar Industries not to let him outside the base and to wait for the arrival of rescue team ""Eliza"".
His suspicions aroused, he manufactures a fake problem to force GERTY to let him outside.
He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds an older Sam Bell, unconscious.

He brings Old Sam back to the base and tends to his injuries.
The two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other.
After a heated argument and physical altercation, they together coerce GERTY into revealing that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell.
GERTY activated New Sam after the rover crash and implanted the memories of the original Sam Bell.

The two Sams begin searching the base, finding live communications jammed by transmitters located beyond the outermost perimeter of the base.
They also discover that four previous clones all started to physically deteriorate three years after awakening.
Told they would hibernate briefly for the journey home, they were actually incinerated after being put to sleep.

The two newest clones also find many more unconscious doubles in a secret hidden vault below the main level.
Old Sam drives past the interference radius in a second rover and calls Tess on Earth.
However, he instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died ""some years ago"".
He hangs up when he hears her father, original Sam, talking in the background and coming toward the screen.

The two Sams realize that the incoming Eliza ""rescue"" team will kill them both if they are found together.
New Sam suggests sending the other to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports, but Old Sam, already badly deteriorated, knows that he will not live much longer.
He suggests New Sam leave instead, and alert the public to Lunar Industries' unethical practices.
Old Sam plans to die by the crashed rover so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything until it is too late.

New Sam orders GERTY to revive a seventh clone to greet the rescuers, then programs a harvester to crash and wreck a jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth.
On the advice of GERTY—and to prevent the ELIZA team from discovering their plan by examining its memory archives—New Sam then reboots GERTY, erasing its records of the event.
Old Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the ship carrying New Sam to Earth.

As the credits roll, the helium transport is depicted entering Earth's upper atmosphere, while news reports describe how ""a Sam Bell clone's"" testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, with the company's shares dipping by a significant margin.","MONITORING STATION -- LATER/MORNING                      49

For a moment there is silence, neither of the Sams knowing

how to react -- going by the message Thompson and

Overmeyers don't know anything about there being two Sams

on the base now.

                You're a fucking clone! You don't

                have shit!



      At once Sam 1 and Sam 2 ROCKET to their feet -- right in

                You're not going anywhere!



      Sam 1 turns around, heads out of the room. Sam 2 STORMS

      after him, TALKING the whole time --

                                               FADE TO BLACK.","Sam Bell nears the end of a three-year work contract as the sole resident at Lunar Industries' largely automated lunar mining base ""Sarang"".
Sam oversees automated harvesters and launches canisters bound for Earth, containing the helium-3 they have extracted.
Chronic communication problems limit him to occasional recorded messages to his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left.
His only companion is an artificial intelligence named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation.

Two weeks before he is to return to Earth, Sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl.
One such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his rover into the harvester.
Rapidly losing air, Sam puts on his helmet, but loses consciousness.

Sam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident.
He overhears GERTY receiving instructions from Lunar Industries not to let him outside the base and to wait for the arrival of rescue team ""Eliza"".
His suspicions aroused, he manufactures a fake problem to force GERTY to let him outside.
He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds an older Sam Bell, unconscious.

He brings Old Sam back to the base and tends to his injuries.
The two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other.
After a heated argument and physical altercation, they together coerce GERTY into revealing that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell.
GERTY activated New Sam after the rover crash and implanted the memories of the original Sam Bell.

The two Sams begin searching the base, finding live communications jammed by transmitters located beyond the outermost perimeter of the base.
They also discover that four previous clones all started to physically deteriorate three years after awakening.
Told they would hibernate briefly for the journey home, they were actually incinerated after being put to sleep.

The two newest clones also find many more unconscious doubles in a secret hidden vault below the main level.
Old Sam drives past the interference radius in a second rover and calls Tess on Earth.
However, he instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died ""some years ago"".
He hangs up when he hears her father, original Sam, talking in the background and coming toward the screen.

The two Sams realize that the incoming Eliza ""rescue"" team will kill them both if they are found together.
New Sam suggests sending the other to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports, but Old Sam, already badly deteriorated, knows that he will not live much longer.
He suggests New Sam leave instead, and alert the public to Lunar Industries' unethical practices.
Old Sam plans to die by the crashed rover so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything until it is too late.

New Sam orders GERTY to revive a seventh clone to greet the rescuers, then programs a harvester to crash and wreck a jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth.
On the advice of GERTY—and to prevent the ELIZA team from discovering their plan by examining its memory archives—New Sam then reboots GERTY, erasing its records of the event.
Old Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the ship carrying New Sam to Earth.

As the credits roll, the helium transport is depicted entering Earth's upper atmosphere, while news reports describe how ""a Sam Bell clone's"" testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, with the company's shares dipping by a significant margin.","166   INT.

An arm grabs Jesus from behind and throws him against the 

wall.



Judas stands in front of him, panting, his dagger in his 

hand.



          JUDAS

     I hissed and you came.



          JESUS

     I'm ready.



          JUDAS

     Ready? You think we're going to a 

     feast? I'm going to kill you.



          JESUS

     Good. I'm relieved. I'm happy to see 

     you. You're just in time.



Judas is startled.



          JESUS

     God purified me tonight. I thought 

     it was so I could go out and preach. 

     But now I see. It's so I could die. 

     And you're God's instrument. He 

     brought us together.



Jesus opens his tunic.



          JESUS

     Here's my neck. Cut it. Come on, cut 

     it. What's the matter? Is there 

     anything wrong? I was purified, you 

     got your permission, it's all arranged 

     by God. So what are you waiting for?



They stare at each other.



          JESUS

     You can't do it, can you?



          JUDAS

     I can if I want.



          JESUS

     Why don't you want?



          JUDAS

     I do want.



          JESUS

     Fine.



He positions himself for killing again. There is another 

pause.



          JUDAS

     Did you work some magic on me? When 

     I go to kill a man, I kill him.



          JESUS

          (thinking it out)

     Maybe God doesn't want me to die. If 

     God really wanted me to die, you 

     wouldn't hesitate. You'd just kill 

     me.



          JUDAS

     No, you should die. What good are 

     you living? Why should God want you 

     alive? What good are you for Israel? 

     Do you have some secret?



          JESUS

     I have no secret. I know that I have 

     pity, though.



          JUDAS

     Pity! How far will that get us? What 

     good is that for Israel?



          JESUS

     It's good for men.



          JUDAS

     Men! The Greeks who killed us were 

     men. So are the Romans. Don't pity 

     men, pity Israel. The rest can go to 

     hell.



          JESUS

     I feel pity for everything. Donkeys, 

     sparrows, grass.



          JUDAS

     And ants? I suppose you feel pity 

     for them too?



          JESUS

     Yes. Everything's a part of God. 

     When I look into the ant, into his 

     shiny black eye, I see the face of 

     God.



          JUDAS

     What do you see when you look in my 

     face?



          JESUS

          (matter of factly)

     I see God too.



          JUDAS

     You see God everywhere, don't you? 

     Maybe that's why you don't fear death.



          JESUS

     Why should I fear death? Death isn't 

     a door that closes, it's a door that 

     opens. It opens and you enter.



          JUDAS

          (pause)

     If I don't kill you, what happens?



          JESUS

     I don't know. Whatever God decides. 

     I'll speak to others. I can't think 

     of anything else.



          JUDAS

     What are you going to say?



          JESUS

     I'll just open my mouth and God will 

     do the talking.



          JUDAS

     See. I told you. You're not crazy at 

     all, are you? If God does talk through 

     you, then you're the messenger of 

     God and I can't kill a messenger of 

     God, can I? You've got my hand 

     stopped.



          JESUS

     I didn't stop your hand, God did.



          JUDAS

     He's the only one who could.



          JESUS

     God didn't send you to kill me. Maybe 

     he sent you here to follow me.



          JUDAS

     The one's I follow are the ones who 

     follow Israel.



Judas puts his knife away.



                              CUT TO:","The film begins with a man whispering in despair, ""The feeling begins.
Very tender, very loving.
Then the pain starts.
Claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up.
Just before they reach my eyes, they dig in.
And I remember.
First I fasted for three months.
I even whipped myself before I went to sleep.
At first it worked.
Then the pain came back.
And the voices.
They call me by the name: Jesus.""
Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is a carpenter in Roman-occupied Judea, torn between his own desires and his knowledge that God has a plan for him.
This conflict results in self-loathing, and he collaborates with the Romans to crucify Jewish revolutionaries.

Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), originally sent to kill Jesus for collaboration,[1] instead suspects that Jesus is the Messiah and asks him to lead a revolution against the Romans.
Jesus replies that his message is love of mankind; whereupon Judas joins Jesus in his ministry, but threatens to kill him if he strays from the purpose of a revolutionary.
Jesus also has an undisclosed prior relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), a Jewish prostitute, who asks Jesus to stay with her, a request that he considers before leaving for a monastic community.
Jesus later saves Mary from a mob gathered to stone her for prostitution and working on the sabbath.
Jesus compels the mob to spare her life, asking ""Who here has never sinned?
"", with Jesus offering two stones.
[2] Later, Jesus preaches to the crowd using many of the parables from the Sermon on the Mount.

Jesus acquires disciples, but remains uncertain of his role.
He visits John the Baptist, who baptizes Jesus, and that night the two discuss their differing theologies and political views.
John believes that one must first gain freedom from the Romans to achieve their end, while Jesus maintains that love is more important and people should tend to matters of the spirit.
Jesus then goes into the desert to test God's connection to himself, where he is tempted by Satan as a cobra, a lion, and a pillar of flame (voiced by Barbara Hershey, Harvey Keitel, and Leo Marks), but resists each of these and instead envisions himself with an axe, being instructed by John the Baptist in answer to Jesus' dilemma of whether to choose the path of love (symbolized by the heart) or the path of violence (represented by the axe).
Jesus returns from the desert to the home of Martha and Mary of Bethany (both sisters of Lazarus), who restore him to health and attempt to persuade him that the way to please God is to have a home, a marriage, and children.
Jesus then appears to his waiting disciples to tear out his own heart and invites them to follow him.
With newfound confidence he restores sight to a blind man, changes water into wine, and raises Lazarus (Tomas Arana) from the dead.

Eventually his ministry reaches Jerusalem, where Jesus performs the Cleansing of the Temple and leads a small army to capture the temple by force, but halts on the steps to await a sign from God for what he must do next.
He begins bleeding from his hands, which he recognizes as a sign that he must die on the cross to bring salvation to mankind.
Confiding in Judas, he persuades the latter to give him to the Romans, despite Judas' inclination otherwise.
Jesus convenes his disciples for Passover seder, later known as the Last Supper; whereupon Judas leads a contingent of soldiers to arrest Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, identifying him with a kiss.
In the struggle to defend his master, Peter (Victor Argo) cuts off the ear of Malchus; whereupon Jesus reattaches it and turns himself over to the soldiers.
Pontius Pilate (David Bowie) confronts Jesus and tells him that he must be put to death because he represents a threat to the Roman Empire.
Jesus is subsequently flogged and a crown of thorns is placed on his head.
He is then crucified.

While on the cross, Jesus converses with a young girl who claims to be his guardian angel (played by Juliette Caton).
She tells him that while he is the Son of God, he is not the Messiah, and that God is pleased with him, and wants him to be happy.
She brings him down off the cross and, invisible to others, takes him to Mary Magdalene, whom he then marries.
They are soon expecting a child and living an idyllic life; but Mary abruptly dies, and Jesus is consoled by his angel; wherefore he takes Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, for his wives.
He starts a family with them, having many children, and lives his life in peace.
Jesus is next seen as an older man who encounters the apostle Paul preaching about the Messiah and tries to tell Paul that he is the man about whom Paul has been preaching.
Paul (who in this film has slain the resurrected Lazarus) repudiates him, saying that even if Jesus had not died on the cross, his message was the truth, and nothing would stop him from proclaiming that.
Jesus debates him, claiming that salvation cannot be founded on lies.

Near the end of his life, an elderly Jesus calls upon his former disciples to his deathbed.
Peter, Nathaniel, and a scarred John visit their master as Jerusalem is in the throes of rebellion; whereupon Judas comes last and reveals that the youthful angel who released Jesus from the crucifixion is in fact Satan.
Crawling back through the burning city of Jerusalem, Jesus reaches the site of his crucifixion and begs God to let him fulfill his purpose and to ""let him be God's son.""

Jesus then finds himself once more on the cross, having overcome the ""last temptation"" of escaping death, being married and raising a family, and the ensuing disaster that would have consequently encompassed mankind.
Naked and bloody, Jesus cries out in ecstasy as he dies, ""It is accomplished!
"", and the screen flickers to white.","MONASTERY - HUT - NIGHT

     I've been looking all over for you. 

     For two days. We're really worried

Jesus collects his thoughts.

     Zealots.



          JESUS

     Your people. Why?



          JUDAS

     Because he was the living proof of 

     your power. Zealots say you're paid 

     by the Romans to tell the people 

     only heaven is important. Not their 

     life now. Not being dominated by 

     Romans. That's very dangerous.



          JESUS

          (quietly)

     Yes. It make everything clearer.



          JUDAS

     Clearer? What are you talking about, 

     clearer? It just makes everything 

     worse. We want a revolution, the 

     Zealots want a revolution but now 

     they're against us. We can't let 

     that happen. We need them.



          JESUS

     Do you want to join them, then?



          JUDAS

     No. They're my brothers, but you're 

     my master.



          JESUS

     You are the strongest, aren't you? 

     Of all my friends, you're the 

     strongest. I have to tell you 

     something.



          JUDAS

     Tell me whatever you want. You can 

     depend on me.

     You know why I came to Jerusalem?



          JUDAS

     This is where we're going to fight. 

     This is where the revolution's going 

     to happen.



Jesus nods.



          JESUS

     Last night Isaiah came to me.



          JUDAS

          (eager)

     What did he say?



          JESUS

     He opened his book and I read in 

     giant letters: 'He has borne our 

     faults; he was wounded for our 

     transgressions. He was afflicted, 

     yet he opened not his mouth. Despised 

     and rejected by all, he went forward 

     without resisting, like a lamb led 

     to the slaughter.'

     So? What does that have to do with 

     you?

     Judas. I'm the lamb. I'm the one who 

     is going to die.



          JUDAS

     What do you mean, die? Die? Did you 

     change your mind again.



          JESUS

     No.



Judas jumps up.



          JUDAS

     Then what are you talking about? 

     That can't be. If you're the Messiah, 

     why do you have to die?



          JESUS

     Don't shout. You'll understand soon. 

     At first I didn't understand myself.



          JUDAS

     Every day you have a different plan. 

     I can't believe it. First it's love, 

     then it's the ax, now you have to 

     die. What good could that do. We 

     need you alive.



          JESUS

     I can't help it. God only talks to 

     me a little at a time. He only shows 

     me as much as I have to know. Now I 

     finally understand. All my life. All 

     my life I've been followed. By 

     footsteps. By voices. By headaches. 

     By shadows. And you know what the 

     shadow is? It's the cross. I have to 

     die on the cross. And I have to die 

     willingly... We need courage, Judas. 

     We need faith. I'm the fulfillment 

     of the prophecy. The cross is the 

     way I have to take.



Judas is dumbfounded, and his anger is mounting.



          JESUS

     So we go to Jerusalem. We go back to 

     the temple. Whatever happens there 

     will put me on the cross.



          JUDAS

          (barely controlling 

          his anger)

     And after you die on the cross? What 

     happens then?



          JESUS

     I'll come back to judge the living 

     and the dead.



          JUDAS

          (pause)

     I don't believe you.



          JESUS

     If you don't believe, nobody will. 

     You have to believe. You're the 

     strongest.

Judas, who has been looking for Jesus, finds him alone on 

the road leading out of the city. JUDAS

     I've been looking all over for you. JUDAS

     Because he was the living proof of 

     your power. JESUS

     Do you want to join them, then? JESUS

     You are the strongest, aren't you? Of all my friends, you're the 

     strongest. JUDAS

     This is where we're going to fight. JESUS

     Last night Isaiah came to me. JESUS

     He opened his book and I read in 

     giant letters: 'He has borne our 

     faults; he was wounded for our 

     transgressions. He was afflicted, 

     yet he opened not his mouth. Despised 

     and rejected by all, he went forward 

     without resisting, like a lamb led 

     to the slaughter.' First it's love, 

     then it's the ax, now you have to 

     die. God only talks to 

     me a little at a time. He only shows 

     me as much as I have to know. And I have to die 

     willingly... We need courage, Judas. I'm the fulfillment 

     of the prophecy. The cross is the 

     way I have to take. JESUS

     I'll come back to judge the living 

     and the dead. JUDAS

Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is a carpenter in Roman-occupied Judea, torn between his own desires and his knowledge that God has a plan for him.
This conflict results in self-loathing, and he collaborates with the Romans to crucify Jewish revolutionaries.

Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), originally sent to kill Jesus for collaboration,[1] instead suspects that Jesus is the Messiah and asks him to lead a revolution against the Romans.
Jesus replies that his message is love of mankind; whereupon Judas joins Jesus in his ministry, but threatens to kill him if he strays from the purpose of a revolutionary.
Jesus also has an undisclosed prior relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), a Jewish prostitute, who asks Jesus to stay with her, a request that he considers before leaving for a monastic community.
Jesus later saves Mary from a mob gathered to stone her for prostitution and working on the sabbath.
Jesus compels the mob to spare her life, asking ""Who here has never sinned?
"", with Jesus offering two stones.
[2] Later, Jesus preaches to the crowd using many of the parables from the Sermon on the Mount.

Jesus acquires disciples, but remains uncertain of his role.
He visits John the Baptist, who baptizes Jesus, and that night the two discuss their differing theologies and political views.
John believes that one must first gain freedom from the Romans to achieve their end, while Jesus maintains that love is more important and people should tend to matters of the spirit.
Jesus then goes into the desert to test God's connection to himself, where he is tempted by Satan as a cobra, a lion, and a pillar of flame (voiced by Barbara Hershey, Harvey Keitel, and Leo Marks), but resists each of these and instead envisions himself with an axe, being instructed by John the Baptist in answer to Jesus' dilemma of whether to choose the path of love (symbolized by the heart) or the path of violence (represented by the axe).
Jesus returns from the desert to the home of Martha and Mary of Bethany (both sisters of Lazarus), who restore him to health and attempt to persuade him that the way to please God is to have a home, a marriage, and children.
Jesus then appears to his waiting disciples to tear out his own heart and invites them to follow him.
With newfound confidence he restores sight to a blind man, changes water into wine, and raises Lazarus (Tomas Arana) from the dead.

Eventually his ministry reaches Jerusalem, where Jesus performs the Cleansing of the Temple and leads a small army to capture the temple by force, but halts on the steps to await a sign from God for what he must do next.
He begins bleeding from his hands, which he recognizes as a sign that he must die on the cross to bring salvation to mankind.
Confiding in Judas, he persuades the latter to give him to the Romans, despite Judas' inclination otherwise.
Jesus convenes his disciples for Passover seder, later known as the Last Supper; whereupon Judas leads a contingent of soldiers to arrest Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, identifying him with a kiss.
In the struggle to defend his master, Peter (Victor Argo) cuts off the ear of Malchus; whereupon Jesus reattaches it and turns himself over to the soldiers.
Pontius Pilate (David Bowie) confronts Jesus and tells him that he must be put to death because he represents a threat to the Roman Empire.
Jesus is subsequently flogged and a crown of thorns is placed on his head.
He is then crucified.

While on the cross, Jesus converses with a young girl who claims to be his guardian angel (played by Juliette Caton).
She tells him that while he is the Son of God, he is not the Messiah, and that God is pleased with him, and wants him to be happy.

Paul -- who we recognize as the Zealot Saul who killed Lazarus -- 

preaches to a handful of villagers. Standing straight, 

radiating confidence, he speaks with the evangelistic fervor 

of a born-again Christian.



          PAUL

     I used to be a sinner. The worst 

     sinner. I did everything. Whored, 

     drank, murdered. I killed anyone who 

     violated the Law of Moses. Then, I 

     was struck by a burning light and a 

     voice called to me, 'Saul, why are 

     you persecuting me? Why are you 

     against me?' 'Who are you?' I said. 

     'Jesus,' the voice said, and he gave 

     me my sight. I opened my eyes and I 

     was baptized and became Paul. I bring 

     the good news to every country.



Jesus comes closer, the Angel by his side.



          PAUL

     I bring this news. About Jesus of 

     Nazareth. He wasn't the son of Mary, 

     he was the son of God. His mother 

     was a virgin. The angel Gabriel came 

     to earth and put God's seed in her 

     womb. That's how he was born. He 

     took on our sins, he was tortured, 

     crucified -- but three days later he 

     rose again and was taken up to heaven. 

     Death was conquered, praise God! 

     Death was conquered, sins were 

     forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven's 

     now open to everyone.



Jesus can restrain himself no longer. He calls out:



          JESUS

     Did you ever see this resurrected 

     Jesus of Nazareth? I mean, with your 

     own eyes?



          PAUL

     No. But I saw a blinding flash of 

     light and I heard his voice.



          JESUS

     You're a liar!



          PAUL

     His disciples saw him. They were 

     hiding in an attic with the doors 

     locked when suddenly he appeared. 

     Only one, Thomas, wasn't convinced 

     but he put his fingers in his wounds 

     and gave Jesus some fish, which he 

     ate.



          JESUS

     Liar!

          (to people around him)

     He's a liar!



Disgusted, Jesus turns and walks away. His angel follows.



In the background, Paul comes after him.



Jesus feels Paul's footsteps drawing closer. He's about to 

explode. Suddenly, he turns on his heel, grabs Paul by the 

shoulders and shakes him violently.



          JESUS

          (continuing)

     You're a liar! I'm Jesus of Nazareth. 

     I was never crucified. I never came 

     back from the dead. I'm a man like 

     everyone else. Why are you spreading 

     these lies?



          ANGEL

     Quiet.



          PAUL

     What are you talking about?



          JESUS

     I'm the son of Mary and Joseph, who 

     preached in Galilee. James and John, 

     the sons of Zebedee, were my 

     disciples. We marched on Jerusalem, 

     they brought me before Pilate, but 

     God saved me.



Jesus' Angel doesn't like this conversation; he tugs violently 

at his sleeve. Jesus shoves him aside. Paul takes Jesus around 

a corner where they won't be seen.



          PAUL

     No he didn't!



          JESUS

     Now I live like a man. I have a 

     family. I eat, work, have children. 

     Do you understand what I'm saying? 

     Don't go around the world spreading 

     these lies about me.

          (shouts)

     Because, I'll tell everyone the truth.



Now it's Paul's turn to explode.



          PAUL

     Look around you! Look at these people. 

     Do you see the suffering and 

     unhappiness in this world? Their 

     only hope is the Resurrected Jesus. 

     I don't care whether you're Jesus or 

     not. The Resurrected Jesus will save 

     the world -- that's what matters.



          JESUS

     The world can't be saved by lies.



          PAUL

     I created the truth. I make it out 

     of longing and faith. I don't struggle 

     to find truth -- I build it. If it's 

     necessary to crucify you to save the 

     world, then I'll crucify you. And 

     I'll resurrect you too, whether you 

     like it or not.



          JESUS

     I won't let you. I'll tell everyone 

     the truth.



          PAUL

     Shout all you want. Who'll believe 

     you? You started all this, now it 

     can't be stopped. The faithful will 

     grab you and call you a blasphemer 

     and throw you in a fire.



          JESUS

     No, that wouldn't happen.



          PAUL

     How do you know? You don't know how 

     much people need God. You don't know 

     what a joy it is to hold the cross, 

     to put hope in the hearts of men, to 

     suffer, to be killed -- all for the 

     sake of Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus 

     of Nazareth, Son of God. Messiah.



Jesus is listening intently now.



          PAUL

          (continuing)

     Not you. Not for your sake.

          (pause)

     I'm glad I met you. Now I can forget 

     you. My Jesus is much more powerful.



Paul returns to the townsquare to preach. Jesus, exhausted,

19672,The Last Temptation of Christ (film),"INT. MARY AND MARTHA'S - NIGHT



Jesus lies dying. He is facing the entrance, in which we can 

see glimmers of the still-burning sky.



Mary and Martha stand close around him. Jesus is in no pain. 

He seems to be at peace.



Suddenly looming in the entranceway, silhouetted against the 

red sky, is the figure of an old man. He starts down the few 

stone steps into the room where Jesus lies. He is followed 

by two other men. The Guardian Angel recognizes them instantly 

and starts toward them.



          PETER

     Let us through. We're sent by God.

          (to Jesus)

     He told us you would show yourself 

     to us. He said you were dying.



          JESUS

     Is that Peter? I can't tell. That is 

     Peter. What happened to you?



          PETER

     The years.



          JESUS

     The years?

          (he points)

     This one I know. No matter how old 

     you get, I know. This is Philip. You 

     were the best of all shepherds, 

     because you had no sheep. They were 

     all in your head.



          PHILIP

     Have I changed so little in all this 

     time?



          JESUS

     Only for the better, I hope.



Jesus points to the mutilated man standing next to Peter. 

The man's face is a mask of injury: he is missing his nose, 

and one eye, and one ear.



          JESUS

     And you? They cut out your eye, your 

     ear. Your face... who are you?

     the Ark of the Covenant taken from 

     the temple.



          JESUS

     The ark?



          PHILIP

     The Temple's destroyed, just as you 

     predicted.



          PETER

     There's somebody else. Outside.



          PHILIP

     Him you'll know. Be careful, he's 

     still angry.



Judas is silhouetted in the entranceway.

          (Judas doesn't answer)

     Judas, come in. Do you hear me? I've 

     missed you so much.



Now Judas advances slowly.

     He hears you. He's just not going to 

     say anything.

     He's been fighting in Jerusalem. 

     Look at his hands. There's still 

     blood on them.

The other disciples stand up.

     Judas, the Master is speaking to 

     you. Answer him.



          JUDAS

     Traitor. Your place was on the cross. 

     That's where God put you. But when 

     death got too close you ran away, 

     you got scared and ran away and hid 

     yourself in the life of some... man. 

     We did what we were supposed to do. 

     You didn't. You're a coward.



          PETER

     Don't you have any respect.



          JUDAS

     For him? He was supposed to save 

     man. But all he did is save himself.



          JESUS

     No. You just don't understand...



          JUDAS

     Understand? Rabbi, you broke my heart. 

     Sometimes I curse the day I ever met 

     you. We held the world in our hands. 

     Remember what you said to me? You 

     took me in your arms, do you remember? 

     And you begged me. ""Betray me, betray 

     me. I have to be crucified. I have 

     to be resurrected to save the world.""



The wounds in Jesus' hands and feet begin to bleed.



          JUDAS

          (continuing)

     ""I am the lamb,"" you said. ""Death is 

     the door. Judas, my brother, don't 

     be afraid. Help me go through the 

     door."" And I loved you so much I 

     went and betrayed you. But you... 

     you... what are you doing here? What 

     business do you have here? With women, 

     with children... what's good for a 

     man isn't good enough for God. Why 

     weren't you crucified?



Judas is crying.



          PETER

     Look at his wounds, Judas. He's 

     bleeding. You're hurting him, that's 

     enough.



          JUDAS

     He was going to be the New Covenant. 

     Now there's no more Israel.



          JESUS

     But my Guardian Angel...



          JUDAS

     Your Guradian Angel! Look at him!



All their eyes turn to the Guardian Angel. As they watch he 

transforms into a death figure in a black monk's habit.



          JUDAS

     Satan.



Judas looks back at Jesus.



          JUDAS

     If you die this way, you die like a 

     man. If you die like that, you deny 

     God. Your Father. Then there's no 

     sacrifice. Then there's no salvation.



Jesus looks over at Mary and Martha, then back at the 

disciples. They have disappeared.



He looks again, and for the last time, at Mary and Martha. 

Now they are gone too.



He is left alone in the room with the death figure.



          DEATH FIGURE

     I told you we would meet again.



Jesus starts to try to pull himself up off the floor. The 

death figure stands in front of him.



          DEATH FIGURE

     There's nothing you can do. You lived 

     this life. You accepted it. It's 

     over now. Just finish it and die 

     like a man.



But Jesus starts to crawl across the floor.



He crawls past the death figure, who watches, turning to see 

Jesus leave through the entranceway.

First I fasted for three months.

At first it worked.
Then the pain came back.
And the voices.
They call me by the name: Jesus.""
Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is a carpenter in Roman-occupied Judea, torn between his own desires and his knowledge that God has a plan for him.
This conflict results in self-loathing, and he collaborates with the Romans to crucify Jewish revolutionaries.

Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), originally sent to kill Jesus for collaboration,[1] instead suspects that Jesus is the Messiah and asks him to lead a revolution against the Romans.
Jesus replies that his message is love of mankind; whereupon Judas joins Jesus in his ministry, but threatens to kill him if he strays from the purpose of a revolutionary.
Jesus also has an undisclosed prior relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), a Jewish prostitute, who asks Jesus to stay with her, a request that he considers before leaving for a monastic community.
Jesus later saves Mary from a mob gathered to stone her for prostitution and working on the sabbath.
Jesus compels the mob to spare her life, asking ""Who here has never sinned?
"", with Jesus offering two stones.
[2] Later, Jesus preaches to the crowd using many of the parables from the Sermon on the Mount.

Jesus acquires disciples, but remains uncertain of his role.
He visits John the Baptist, who baptizes Jesus, and that night the two discuss their differing theologies and political views.
John believes that one must first gain freedom from the Romans to achieve their end, while Jesus maintains that love is more important and people should tend to matters of the spirit.
Jesus then goes into the desert to test God's connection to himself, where he is tempted by Satan as a cobra, a lion, and a pillar of flame (voiced by Barbara Hershey, Harvey Keitel, and Leo Marks), but resists each of these and instead envisions himself with an axe, being instructed by John the Baptist in answer to Jesus' dilemma of whether to choose the path of love (symbolized by the heart) or the path of violence (represented by the axe).
Jesus returns from the desert to the home of Martha and Mary of Bethany (both sisters of Lazarus), who restore him to health and attempt to persuade him that the way to please God is to have a home, a marriage, and children.
Jesus then appears to his waiting disciples to tear out his own heart and invites them to follow him.
With newfound confidence he restores sight to a blind man, changes water into wine, and raises Lazarus (Tomas Arana) from the dead.

Eventually his ministry reaches Jerusalem, where Jesus performs the Cleansing of the Temple and leads a small army to capture the temple by force, but halts on the steps to await a sign from God for what he must do next.
He begins bleeding from his hands, which he recognizes as a sign that he must die on the cross to bring salvation to mankind.
Confiding in Judas, he persuades the latter to give him to the Romans, despite Judas' inclination otherwise.
Jesus convenes his disciples for Passover seder, later known as the Last Supper; whereupon Judas leads a contingent of soldiers to arrest Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, identifying him with a kiss.
In the struggle to defend his master, Peter (Victor Argo) cuts off the ear of Malchus; whereupon Jesus reattaches it and turns himself over to the soldiers.
Pontius Pilate (David Bowie) confronts Jesus and tells him that he must be put to death because he represents a threat to the Roman Empire.
Jesus is subsequently flogged and a crown of thorns is placed on his head.
He is then crucified.

While on the cross, Jesus converses with a young girl who claims to be his guardian angel (played by Juliette Caton).
She tells him that while he is the Son of God, he is not the Messiah, and that God is pleased with him, and wants him to be happy.
She brings him down off the cross and, invisible to others, takes him to Mary Magdalene, whom he then marries.
They are soon expecting a child and living an idyllic life; but Mary abruptly dies, and Jesus is consoled by his angel; wherefore he takes Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, for his wives.
He starts a family with them, having many children, and lives his life in peace.
Jesus is next seen as an older man who encounters the apostle Paul preaching about the Messiah and tries to tell Paul that he is the man about whom Paul has been preaching.
Paul (who in this film has slain the resurrected Lazarus) repudiates him, saying that even if Jesus had not died on the cross, his message was the truth, and nothing would stop him from proclaiming that.
Jesus debates him, claiming that salvation cannot be founded on lies.

Near the end of his life, an elderly Jesus calls upon his former disciples to his deathbed.
Peter, Nathaniel, and a scarred John visit their master as Jerusalem is in the throes of rebellion; whereupon Judas comes last and reveals that the youthful angel who released Jesus from the crucifixion is in fact Satan.
Crawling back through the burning city of Jerusalem, Jesus reaches the site of his crucifixion and begs God to let him fulfill his purpose and to ""let him be God's son.""

Jesus then finds himself once more on the cross, having overcome the ""last temptation"" of escaping death, being married and raising a family, and the ensuing disaster that would have consequently encompassed mankind.
Naked and bloody, Jesus cries out in ecstasy as he dies, ""It is accomplished!
"", and the screen flickers to white.","MARY AND MARTHA'S - NIGHT



Jesus lies dying. He starts down the few 

stone steps into the room where Jesus lies. The Guardian Angel recognizes them instantly 

and starts toward them. (to Jesus)

     He told us you would show yourself 

     to us. Jesus points to the mutilated man standing next to Peter. PHILIP

     predicted. He's just not going to

19696,The Last Temptation of Christ (film),"EXT. GOLGOTHA - DAY



The sky turns a pleasant pale blue. Jesus looks up at the 

thick white cumulous clouds floating on the horizon. Birds 

sing in the distance.



He thinks: Am I dead? No, the crowd is still there, SILENT. 

On either side of Jesus, his fellow criminals writhe in silent 

agony.



An old man appears before him, standing.



          JESUS

     Who are you?



The man does not answer.



          JESUS

     Are you my father?



          ANGEL

     No, but I was sent by him. I'm the 

     angel who guards you.



He is now closer to Jesus.



          ANGEL

     Your father is the God of Mercy, not 

     punishment. He saw you and said, 

     'Aren't you his Guardian Angel? Well, 

     go down and save him. He's suffered 

     enough.' Remember when he told Abraham 

     to sacrifice his son? Just as Abraham 

     lifted his knife, God saved Isaac. 

     If he saved Abraham's son, don't you 

     think he'd want to save his own? He 

     tested you, and he's pleased. He 

     doesn't want your blood. He said, 

     ""Let him die in a dream. But let him 

     have his life."" Come with me.



          JESUS

     All this pain is a dream?



          ANGEL

     Just a dream.



In three separate shots, the Angel takes out the nails in 

Jesus' body.



First, the Angel extracts the nail in the feet, then kisses 

the wound, stopping the flow of blood.



Then, the Angel does the same to the left hand.



Then, the same is done on the right hand.



In a moment Jesus and the Guardian Angel are standing at the 

foot of the cross. They pass through the silent crowd 

unnoticed. Jesus looks over his shoulder: his cross is empty. 

He begins to understand.



          JESUS

     I don't have to be sacrificed.



          ANGEL

     No. No you don't.



Jesus smiles. This is finally the answer he's been waiting 

for. He is free of God.



          JESUS

     I'm not the Messiah.



          ANGEL

     No. No you're not.



          JESUS

     Thank God.



They start to walk away from the cross down the hill. We 

still see the crucifixion site in the background.



          JESUS

     What about all the others?



          ANGEL

     Don't look behind, God gave you the 

     gift of life. Look ahead.



          JESUS

     But what about the people? What will 

     happen?



          ANGEL

     They can see you crucified. Or they'll 

     see you dead. Or they can see you 

     any way they want.



          JESUS

     What happens later if they see me 

     alive?



          ANGEL

     They'll see any one you want them to 

     see. Even you. If you want.



          JESUS

     Where are the disciples?

     the Kingdom.

Peter passes by and rushes a little anxiously to catch up 

with Jesus, who is walking at the front of the line.



          PETER

     I've been talking with the others, 

     and listening, and a lot of us are a 

     little concerned, we're wondering... 

     well... will you have legions of 

     angels meeting us there? Or anyone? 

     Besides who's here?



Jesus doesn't answer, but he puts his arm around Peter's 

shoulder.



                              CUT TO:","The film begins with a man whispering in despair, ""The feeling begins.
Very tender, very loving.
Then the pain starts.
Claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up.
Just before they reach my eyes, they dig in.
And I remember.
First I fasted for three months.
I even whipped myself before I went to sleep.
At first it worked.
Then the pain came back.
And the voices.
They call me by the name: Jesus.""
Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is a carpenter in Roman-occupied Judea, torn between his own desires and his knowledge that God has a plan for him.
This conflict results in self-loathing, and he collaborates with the Romans to crucify Jewish revolutionaries.

Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), originally sent to kill Jesus for collaboration,[1] instead suspects that Jesus is the Messiah and asks him to lead a revolution against the Romans.
Jesus replies that his message is love of mankind; whereupon Judas joins Jesus in his ministry, but threatens to kill him if he strays from the purpose of a revolutionary.
Jesus also has an undisclosed prior relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), a Jewish prostitute, who asks Jesus to stay with her, a request that he considers before leaving for a monastic community.
Jesus later saves Mary from a mob gathered to stone her for prostitution and working on the sabbath.
Jesus compels the mob to spare her life, asking ""Who here has never sinned?
"", with Jesus offering two stones.
[2] Later, Jesus preaches to the crowd using many of the parables from the Sermon on the Mount.

Jesus acquires disciples, but remains uncertain of his role.
He visits John the Baptist, who baptizes Jesus, and that night the two discuss their differing theologies and political views.
John believes that one must first gain freedom from the Romans to achieve their end, while Jesus maintains that love is more important and people should tend to matters of the spirit.
Jesus then goes into the desert to test God's connection to himself, where he is tempted by Satan as a cobra, a lion, and a pillar of flame (voiced by Barbara Hershey, Harvey Keitel, and Leo Marks), but resists each of these and instead envisions himself with an axe, being instructed by John the Baptist in answer to Jesus' dilemma of whether to choose the path of love (symbolized by the heart) or the path of violence (represented by the axe).
Jesus returns from the desert to the home of Martha and Mary of Bethany (both sisters of Lazarus), who restore him to health and attempt to persuade him that the way to please God is to have a home, a marriage, and children.
Jesus then appears to his waiting disciples to tear out his own heart and invites them to follow him.
With newfound confidence he restores sight to a blind man, changes water into wine, and raises Lazarus (Tomas Arana) from the dead.

Eventually his ministry reaches Jerusalem, where Jesus performs the Cleansing of the Temple and leads a small army to capture the temple by force, but halts on the steps to await a sign from God for what he must do next.
He begins bleeding from his hands, which he recognizes as a sign that he must die on the cross to bring salvation to mankind.
Confiding in Judas, he persuades the latter to give him to the Romans, despite Judas' inclination otherwise.
Jesus convenes his disciples for Passover seder, later known as the Last Supper; whereupon Judas leads a contingent of soldiers to arrest Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, identifying him with a kiss.
In the struggle to defend his master, Peter (Victor Argo) cuts off the ear of Malchus; whereupon Jesus reattaches it and turns himself over to the soldiers.
Pontius Pilate (David Bowie) confronts Jesus and tells him that he must be put to death because he represents a threat to the Roman Empire.
Jesus is subsequently flogged and a crown of thorns is placed on his head.
He is then crucified.

While on the cross, Jesus converses with a young girl who claims to be his guardian angel (played by Juliette Caton).
She tells him that while he is the Son of God, he is not the Messiah, and that God is pleased with him, and wants him to be happy.
She brings him down off the cross and, invisible to others, takes him to Mary Magdalene, whom he then marries.
They are soon expecting a child and living an idyllic life; but Mary abruptly dies, and Jesus is consoled by his angel; wherefore he takes Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, for his wives.
He starts a family with them, having many children, and lives his life in peace.
Jesus is next seen as an older man who encounters the apostle Paul preaching about the Messiah and tries to tell Paul that he is the man about whom Paul has been preaching.
Paul (who in this film has slain the resurrected Lazarus) repudiates him, saying that even if Jesus had not died on the cross, his message was the truth, and nothing would stop him from proclaiming that.
Jesus debates him, claiming that salvation cannot be founded on lies.

Near the end of his life, an elderly Jesus calls upon his former disciples to his deathbed.
Peter, Nathaniel, and a scarred John visit their master as Jerusalem is in the throes of rebellion; whereupon Judas comes last and reveals that the youthful angel who released Jesus from the crucifixion is in fact Satan.
Crawling back through the burning city of Jerusalem, Jesus reaches the site of his crucifixion and begs God to let him fulfill his purpose and to ""let him be God's son.""

Jesus then finds himself once more on the cross, having overcome the ""last temptation"" of escaping death, being married and raising a family, and the ensuing disaster that would have consequently encompassed mankind.
Naked and bloody, Jesus cries out in ecstasy as he dies, ""It is accomplished!
"", and the screen flickers to white.","OUTSIDE JERUSALEM - DAY

The IRA demands the release of other gaoled IRA members, threatening to execute Jody in three days if their demands are not met.
While the amiable Fergus guards Jody, they develop a bond – much to the chagrin of the other IRA men.
During this time, Jody tells Fergus the story about the Scorpion and the Frog.

Jody persuades Fergus to promise to seek out his girlfriend, Dil, in London, to tell her he loved her, and protect her after Jody has been killed.
The deadline set by Jody's captors passes and Jody is to be executed.
Fergus takes Jody into the woods to carry out the sentence.
However, Jody knows that Fergus is no murderer at heart, and makes a break for it.
Sure enough, Fergus cannot bring himself to shoot the fleeing Jody in the back, but Jody is instead accidentally run over and killed by British Saracen armoured personnel carrier as they suddenly move in to assault the IRA safe-house.
With his IRA companions seemingly dead after the attack, Fergus hides from the main body of the IRA in London, where he takes a job as a day labourer, using the alias ""Jimmy"".
While in London, Fergus seeks out and meets Jody's attractive girlfriend Dil at a hair salon.
Later they talk in a bar, where the next evening he sees her singing ""The Crying Game"".

Fergus still suffers from guilt about Jody's death and sees him in his dreams bowling a cricket ball to him.
He continues to pursue Dil, protecting her from an obsessive suitor and gradually falling in love with her.
Later, when he is about to make love to her in her apartment, he discovers that she is in fact a transgender woman.
His initial reaction is of revulsion.
Rushing to the bathroom to throw up, he accidentally hits Dil in the face, leaving her with a nosebleed.
He then leaves the apartment.
A few days later, Fergus leaves Dil a note, and the two make up.
Despite everything, Dil is still attracted to him.
Around the same time, Jude unexpectedly reappears in Fergus' apartment.
She tells him that the IRA has tried and convicted him in absentia.
She forces him to agree to help with a new mission to aid in assassinating a judge.
She also off-handedly mentions that she knows about Fergus and Dil, warning him that the IRA will kill her if Fergus does not co-operate.

Fergus, however, cannot overcome his feelings for Dil, and continues wooing her.
Fergus shields her from possible retribution by giving her a haircut and male clothes, as a disguise.
The night before the IRA mission is to be carried out, Dil gets heavily drunk and Fergus has to escort her to her apartment, where Dil asks for Fergus to stay with her.
Fergus complies, then admits to Dil that he had an indirect hand in her former boyfriend's death.
Dil, drunk, appears not to have understood, but in the morning, before Fergus wakes up, Dil ties him to the bed.
Dil unwittingly prevents Fergus from joining the other IRA members and completing the planned assassination.
Holding Fergus at gunpoint, Dil forces him to tell Dil that he loves her and will never leave her.
Dil unties him, saying that, even if he is lying, it is still nice to hear his words.
Dil then breaks down in tears.

Meanwhile, Jude and Maguire gun the judge down, but Maguire is shot dead by one of his bodyguards.
A vengeful Jude enters Dil's flat with a gun, seeking to kill Fergus for missing the assassination.
Dil takes several shots at Jude, hitting her, whilst stating that she is aware that Jude was complicit in Jody's death and that Jude used her sexuality to trick him.
Dil finally kills Jude with a shot in the neck.
Dil then points the gun at Fergus, but lowers her hand, saying that she cannot kill him, because Jody will not allow her to.
Fergus prevents Dil from shooting herself, and tells her to hide out in the club for a while.
When Dil is gone, he wipes Dil's fingerprints off the gun and allows himself to be arrested in place of Dil.

The epilogue takes place a few months later – Fergus, in prison serving a sentence of over six years, is visited by Dil.
Dil, after talking with Fergus about plans once he gets out of prison, asks him why he took the fall for her in the first place.
Fergus responds, ""As a man once said, it's in my nature.""

                                                          72.","The film opens as a psychological thriller – IRA foot soldier Fergus and a unit of other IRA fighters, including a woman named Jude and led by Maguire, kidnap Jody, a black British soldier after Jude lures him to a secluded area with the promise of sex.
The IRA demands the release of other gaoled IRA members, threatening to execute Jody in three days if their demands are not met.
While the amiable Fergus guards Jody, they develop a bond – much to the chagrin of the other IRA men.
During this time, Jody tells Fergus the story about the Scorpion and the Frog.

Jody persuades Fergus to promise to seek out his girlfriend, Dil, in London, to tell her he loved her, and protect her after Jody has been killed.
The deadline set by Jody's captors passes and Jody is to be executed.
Fergus takes Jody into the woods to carry out the sentence.
However, Jody knows that Fergus is no murderer at heart, and makes a break for it.
Sure enough, Fergus cannot bring himself to shoot the fleeing Jody in the back, but Jody is instead accidentally run over and killed by British Saracen armoured personnel carrier as they suddenly move in to assault the IRA safe-house.
With his IRA companions seemingly dead after the attack, Fergus hides from the main body of the IRA in London, where he takes a job as a day labourer, using the alias ""Jimmy"".
While in London, Fergus seeks out and meets Jody's attractive girlfriend Dil at a hair salon.
Later they talk in a bar, where the next evening he sees her singing ""The Crying Game"".

Fergus still suffers from guilt about Jody's death and sees him in his dreams bowling a cricket ball to him.
He continues to pursue Dil, protecting her from an obsessive suitor and gradually falling in love with her.
Later, when he is about to make love to her in her apartment, he discovers that she is in fact a transgender woman.
His initial reaction is of revulsion.
Rushing to the bathroom to throw up, he accidentally hits Dil in the face, leaving her with a nosebleed.
He then leaves the apartment.
A few days later, Fergus leaves Dil a note, and the two make up.
Despite everything, Dil is still attracted to him.
Around the same time, Jude unexpectedly reappears in Fergus' apartment.
She tells him that the IRA has tried and convicted him in absentia.
She forces him to agree to help with a new mission to aid in assassinating a judge.
She also off-handedly mentions that she knows about Fergus and Dil, warning him that the IRA will kill her if Fergus does not co-operate.

Fergus, however, cannot overcome his feelings for Dil, and continues wooing her.
Fergus shields her from possible retribution by giving her a haircut and male clothes, as a disguise.
The night before the IRA mission is to be carried out, Dil gets heavily drunk and Fergus has to escort her to her apartment, where Dil asks for Fergus to stay with her.
Fergus complies, then admits to Dil that he had an indirect hand in her former boyfriend's death.
Dil, drunk, appears not to have understood, but in the morning, before Fergus wakes up, Dil ties him to the bed.
Dil unwittingly prevents Fergus from joining the other IRA members and completing the planned assassination.
Holding Fergus at gunpoint, Dil forces him to tell Dil that he loves her and will never leave her.
Dil unties him, saying that, even if he is lying, it is still nice to hear his words.
Dil then breaks down in tears.

Meanwhile, Jude and Maguire gun the judge down, but Maguire is shot dead by one of his bodyguards.
A vengeful Jude enters Dil's flat with a gun, seeking to kill Fergus for missing the assassination.
Dil takes several shots at Jude, hitting her, whilst stating that she is aware that Jude was complicit in Jody's death and that Jude used her sexuality to trick him.
Dil finally kills Jude with a shot in the neck.
Dil then points the gun at Fergus, but lowers her hand, saying that she cannot kill him, because Jody will not allow her to.
Fergus prevents Dil from shooting herself, and tells her to hide out in the club for a while.
When Dil is gone, he wipes Dil's fingerprints off the gun and allows himself to be arrested in place of Dil.

The epilogue takes place a few months later – Fergus, in prison serving a sentence of over six years, is visited by Dil.
Dil, after talking with Fergus about plans once he gets out of prison, asks him why he took the fall for her in the first place.
Fergus responds, ""As a man once said, it's in my nature.""
He then tells her the story of the Scorpion and the Frog.","EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Jude in her gun shoulder. Jude spins one way, the gun the

gathered. The wail of police sirens coming closer. He watches

Jody, sitting in the hood. Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's

mouth, with blood now in his lips.

          Is it bad?



                        JODY

          No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know

          that, Fergus?

          I didn't.



                        JODY

          Some kinds of women are...

            Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.



                      FERGUS

            You liked her?



                      JODY

            Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever

            she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus.

            Will you think of her too?



                      FERGUS

            Don't know her.



                      JODY

            Want you to do something, Fergus.

            What?



                      JODY

                      FERGUS

            Don't think that way.



                      JODY

            But they will. As sure as night follows

            day. They have to. I want you to find her

            out. Tell her I was thinking of her.



Fergus is moved. He can't reply.



                      JODY

            See if she's all right.



                      FERGUS

            I don't know her.



                      JODY

            Take her picture. C'mere.



Fergus walks toward him.



                      JODY

            Take it. In the inside pocket.



Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her

picture.

                        JODY

          Take the whole lot. I won't need it.



                        FERGUS

          I told you not to talk that way --



                        JODY

          Go to Millie's Hair Salon in

          Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a

          margarita. Don't have to tell her who you

          are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --

          Stop it --



The door opens. Maguire is there, with another.



                        MAGUIRE

          Volunteer?



Fergus turns toward him.



                        MAGUIRE

          We need you inside.



Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward,

takes his seat. Fergus, unseen by Maguire, puts the wallet in

his pocket."

The IRA demands the release of other gaoled IRA members, threatening to execute Jody in three days if their demands are not met.
While the amiable Fergus guards Jody, they develop a bond – much to the chagrin of the other IRA men.
During this time, Jody tells Fergus the story about the Scorpion and the Frog.

Jody persuades Fergus to promise to seek out his girlfriend, Dil, in London, to tell her he loved her, and protect her after Jody has been killed.

Fergus takes Jody into the woods to carry out the sentence.
However, Jody knows that Fergus is no murderer at heart, and makes a break for it.

He sees Jude sitting in the corner. Her hair is now dark

brown.



                        JUDE

          You vanished.



He stares at her, says nothing.



                        JUDE

          What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the

          gaff on us or did you just fuck up?

          Leave me alone, Jude.

          happen?

          useful that could be.

          not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The

          wee black chick.



He leaps up from the bed.

          You know we won't leave her out of this.

          question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No

          sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.

She forces him to agree to help with a new mission to aid in assassinating a judge.
She also off-handedly mentions that she knows about Fergus and Dil, warning him that the IRA will kill her if Fergus does not co-operate.

Fergus, however, cannot overcome his feelings for Dil, and continues wooing her.
Fergus shields her from possible retribution by giving her a haircut and male clothes, as a disguise.
The night before the IRA mission is to be carried out, Dil gets heavily drunk and Fergus has to escort her to her apartment, where Dil asks for Fergus to stay with her.
Fergus complies, then admits to Dil that he had an indirect hand in her former boyfriend's death.
Dil, drunk, appears not to have understood, but in the morning, before Fergus wakes up, Dil ties him to the bed.
Dil unwittingly prevents Fergus from joining the other IRA members and completing the planned assassination.
Holding Fergus at gunpoint, Dil forces him to tell Dil that he loves her and will never leave her.
Dil unties him, saying that, even if he is lying, it is still nice to hear his words.
Dil then breaks down in tears.

Meanwhile, Jude and Maguire gun the judge down, but Maguire is shot dead by one of his bodyguards.
A vengeful Jude enters Dil's flat with a gun, seeking to kill Fergus for missing the assassination.
Dil takes several shots at Jude, hitting her, whilst stating that she is aware that Jude was complicit in Jody's death and that Jude used her sexuality to trick him.
Dil finally kills Jude with a shot in the neck.
Dil then points the gun at Fergus, but lowers her hand, saying that she cannot kill him, because Jody will not allow her to.
Fergus prevents Dil from shooting herself, and tells her to hide out in the club for a while.
When Dil is gone, he wipes Dil's fingerprints off the gun and allows himself to be arrested in place of Dil.

The epilogue takes place a few months later – Fergus, in prison serving a sentence of over six years, is visited by Dil.
Dil, after talking with Fergus about plans once he gets out of prison, asks him why he took the fall for her in the first place.
Fergus responds, ""As a man once said, it's in my nature.""
He then tells her the story of the Scorpion and the Frog.","EXT. DUBLIN BAY - EVENING.

She initially considers an abortion.
Going to a local clinic run by a women's group, she encounters outside a school mate who is holding a rather pathetic one-person Pro-Life vigil.
Once inside, however, Juno is alienated by the clinic staff's authoritarian and bureaucratic attitudes.
She is particularly offended by their calling her ""sexually active"", a term which she feels demeans the highly emotional event by which she became pregnant.

                              (extracting a bagged 

                              COMIC from the box)

                         Here it is.



               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called ""Most Fruitful Yuki."" 

               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking 

               names.



                                     JUNO

                         ""Most Fruitful Yuki""? What is... Oh 

                         my god, she's a pregnant superhero!



                                     MARK

                         Isn't that great? I got it when I 

                         was in Japan with my band. She reminds 

                         me of you.



               Juno examines the comic. ""Most Fruitful Yuki"" does resemble 

               her.



                                     JUNO

                         Wow, I actually feel like less of a 

                         fat dork now.



                                     MARK

                         Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. 

                         You should be proud to be the same 

                         condition.



               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!



               Juno is sincerely pleased.



                                     JUNO

                         Okay, how about some tunes?



               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno 

               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.



                                     JUNO

                         Now this first one is kinda slow. 

                         But it's Mott the Hoople so it's 

                         still totally rad and hardcore.



               Juno puts in the CD and ""All The Young Dudes"" fills the room.



               Mark Laughs.



                                     JUNO

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         I actually know this one.



                                     JUNO

                         You do?



                                     MARK

                         Yeah, this song's older than me, if 

                         you can believe that. I danced to it 

                         at my senior prom.



                                     JUNO

                         That's almost interesting, Mark. Who 

                         did you dance with?



                                     MARK

                         Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she 

                         was a good dance partner. Even let 

                         me put my hands on her butt.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh man, I can just picture you slow 

                         dancing like a dork!



               She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves 

               back and forth stiffly.



                                     MARK

                         No, I put my hands on your waist. 

                         Then you put your arms around my 

                         neck. That's how we did it in '88.



               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 

               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh, okay. Like this.



                                     MARK

                         You've never been to a dance, have 

                         you?



                                     JUNO

                              (casually defensive)

                         Only squares and nerds go to dances.



                                     MARK

                         What are you?



                                     JUNO

                         I don't know.



               They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against 

               Mark.



                                     MARK

                         I feel like there's something between 

                         us.



               They laugh.



               Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence 

               for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close 

               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.



                                     MARK

                         I'm leaving Vanessa.



                                     JUNO

                              (quiet at first)

                         What?



                                     MARK

                         It's just not working out, but I'm 

                         getting my own place in the city... 

                         and I've got it all planned out. 

                         It's something I've wanted to do for 

                         a long time...



               Juno backs away.



                                     JUNO

                              (growing)

                                     MARK

                         No?



                                     JUNO

                         No. No, you definitely cannot do 

                         that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack 

                         of no!



                                     MARK

                         What's the matter?



                                     JUNO

                         This isn't what we agreed on. You 

                         guys have to take care of... this! 

                         You are the chosen custodians of the 

                         big-ass bump!



               She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters 

               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.



                                     MARK

                         But I thought you'd be cool if...

                         I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. 

                         I wanted everything to be perfect.

                         the baby, Vanessa is going to finally 

                         be happy, and everything will be all 

                         right. Believe me on this one!

                         A baby is not going to fix everything. 

                         Besides, I don't know if I'm ready 

                         to be a father.

                                     JUNO

                         I don't know. I just liked being 

                         your friend. I sort of liked becoming 

                         furniture in your weird life.



                                     MARK

                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? 

                         Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?



                                     MARK

                         That's not the point. We're just not 

                         in love anymore.



                                     JUNO

                         Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa 

                         when you married her? If you love 

                         someone once, you can love them again, 

                         I know it. My friend Leah has gone 

                         out with the same guy, like, four 

                         times. You're just not trying.



               Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.



                                     MARK

                         I'm such an idiot. I can't believe 

                         what an idiot I am.



               He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.



                                     JUNO

                         Please don't get a divorce! God, 

                         Mark, just do me a solid and stay 

                         with your wife.



                                     MARK

                         Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old 

                         enough to tell when people are acting 

                         like total a-holes!



               Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 

               Mark.



                                     JUNO

                         Oh and by the way, I bought another 

                         Sonic Youth album and it's the worst 

                         thing I've ever heard! It's just 

                         noise, man!



               She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.","Sixteen-year-old Minnesota high-schooler Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) discovers she is pregnant with a child fathered by her friend and longtime admirer, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).
She initially considers an abortion.
Going to a local clinic run by a women's group, she encounters outside a school mate who is holding a rather pathetic one-person Pro-Life vigil.
Once inside, however, Juno is alienated by the clinic staff's authoritarian and bureaucratic attitudes.
She is particularly offended by their calling her ""sexually active"", a term which she feels demeans the highly emotional event by which she became pregnant.
All of this decides her against abortion, and she decides to give the baby up for adoption.
With the help of her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby), Juno searches the ads in the Pennysaver and finds a couple she feels will provide a suitable home.
She tells her parents, Mac (J.K. Simmons) and stepmother, Bren (Allison Janney), who offer their support.
With Mac, Juno meets the couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), in their expensive home and agrees to a closed adoption.

Juno visits Mark a few times, with whom she shares tastes in punk rock and horror films.
Mark, who has set aside his rock band youth (now confined to memorabilia displayed in the one room of the house that Vanessa has designated for Mark's personal belongings), works at home composing commercial jingles.
Juno and Leah happen to see Vanessa in a shopping mall being completely at ease with a child, and Juno encourages Vanessa to talk to her baby in the womb, where it obligingly kicks for her.

As the pregnancy progresses, Juno struggles with the emotions she feels for the baby's father, Paulie, who is clearly in love with Juno.
Juno maintains an outwardly indifferent attitude toward Paulie, but when she learns he has asked another girl to the upcoming prom, she angrily confronts him.
Paulie reminds Juno that it is at her request they remain distant and tells her that she broke his heart.

Not long before her baby is due, Juno is again visiting Mark when their interaction becomes emotional.
Mark then tells her he will be leaving Vanessa.
Juno is horrified by this revelation, with Mark asking Juno ""how do you think of me"".
Vanessa arrives home, and Mark tells her he does not feel ready to be a father and there are still things he wants to do first.
Juno watches the Loring marriage fall apart, then drives away and breaks down in tears by the side of the road.
Returning to the Lorings' home, she leaves a note and disappears as they answer the door.

After a heartfelt discussion with Mac, Juno accepts that she loves Paulie.
Juno then tells Paulie she loves him, and Paulie's actions make it clear her feelings are very much reciprocated.
Not long after, Juno goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital, where she gives birth to a baby boy.
She had deliberately not told Paulie because of his track meet.
Seeing her missing from the stands, Paulie rushes to the hospital, finds Juno has given birth to their son, and comforts Juno as she cries.
Vanessa comes to the hospital where she joyfully claims the newborn boy as a single adoptive mother.
On the wall in the baby's new nursery, Vanessa has framed Juno's note, which reads: ""Vanessa: If you're still in, I'm still in.
—Juno.""
The film ends in the summertime with Juno and Paulie playing guitar and singing together, followed by a kiss.","LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON 87



               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and

Munny is thirty-five or forty years old, his hair is

thinning and his moustache droops glumly over his stubbled

jaw.  If it were not for his eyes he would look like any pig

farmer with his canvas overalls tucked in his boots pushing

on a hog.  He is pushing on the hog again, grunting with the

            (looking up, startled)

             Huh?



THE KID is only six feet away, the sun behind him, sitting

on a very big and very ancient Morgan horse.  He's wearing

a wide-brimmed Texas hat, a vest, a holstered pistol, and he

is a wiry kid, maybe twenty years old, with scraggly blonde

hair, four of his upper front teeth missing, and a funny,

squinty way of looking out of his watery blue eyes.  Most of

all, he doesn't look very prosperous.



             THE KID

     I seen how you got only three

     fingers on your left hand, though,

     so I guess you're calling yourself

up with his seven-year-old sister, PENNY, right on his

heels.  The kids are ragged and dirty, they don't look well

fed or even very healthy.  Even as Will speaks to his

father, Munny, his eyes, and Penny's too, go to The Kid.

They don't see many strangers.

Munny ignores the question, already on his way to the

miserable-looking shack.



              MUNNY

     Let's talk inside, mister.","A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, led by Strawberry Alice, offer a $1,000 reward to whoever can kill Quick Mike and ""Davey-Boy"" Bunting, two cowboys who disfigured Delilah Fitzgerald, one of their own.
The local sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, a former gunfighter and keeper of the peace, is worried about their incentive, as he does not allow guns or criminals in his town.
Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime.

Miles away in Kansas, the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man, visits the pig farm of William Munny, seeking to recruit him to kill the cowboys.
In his youth, Munny was a bandit notorious as a cold-blooded murderer.
Now a repentant widower raising two children, he has sworn off alcohol and killing.
Though Munny initially refuses to help with the execution, his farm is failing, putting his children's future in jeopardy.
Munny reconsiders a few days later and sets off to catch up with the Kid.
On his way, Munny recruits Ned Logan, another retired gunfighter, who reluctantly leaves his wife to go along.

Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob and his biographer, W. W. Beauchamp, arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward.
Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob, and Bill beats him savagely, hoping to discourage other would-be killers.
The next morning he ejects Bob from town, but Beauchamp decides to stay and write about Bill.
He has impressed the biographer with his tales of old gunfights and seeming knowledge of the inner workings of a gunfighter's psyche.

Munny, Logan and the Kid arrive later during a rain storm; they go to the saloon/whorehouse to discover the cowboys' location.
With a bad fever after riding in the rain, Munny is sitting alone in the saloon when Little Bill and his deputies arrive to confront him.
With no idea of Munny's past, Little Bill beats him and kicks him out of the saloon after finding a pistol on him.
Logan and the Kid, upstairs getting ""advances"" on their payment from the prostitutes, escape out a back window.
The three regroup at a barn outside of town, where they nurse Munny back to health.

Three days later, they ambush a group of cowboys and kill Bunting.
Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder.
Logan decides to return home while Munny and the Kid head to the cowboys' ranch, where the Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him.
After they escape, a distraught Kid confesses he had never killed anyone before.
He renounces life as a gunfighter.

When Little Sue meets the two men to give them the reward, they learn that Logan was captured by Little Bill's men and tortured to death.
He revealed the names of his two accomplices.
The Kid heads back to Kansas to deliver the reward money to Munny and Logan's families.
Munny drinks a little whisky from Ned's bottle and heads into town to take revenge on Bill.

That night, Logan's corpse is displayed in a coffin outside the saloon.
Inside, Little Bill has assembled a posse to pursue Munny and the Kid.
Munny walks in alone and kills Skinny Dubois, the saloon owner and pimp.
After some tense dialogue, a gunfight ensues, leaving Bill wounded and several of his deputies dead.
Munny orders everyone out before stopping Little Bill from reaching for his pistol.
Bill curses Munny before the latter finishes him with a final gunshot.
Munny threatens the townsfolk before finally leaving town, warning that he will return if Logan is not buried properly or if any prostitutes are further harmed.

A brief epilogue states that Munny was rumored to have moved to San Francisco, where he prospered in dry goods.","HOG PEN - DAY 7

           LITTLE BILL

     What's your name?



              MUNNY

     Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.



Little Sue looks timidly in from the Billiard Room, bites

her lip, and retreats quickly.



           LITTLE BILL

     Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was

     to call you a no good sonofabitch

     an' a liar, an' if I was to say

     you shit in your pants on account

     of a cowardly soul... well, I

     guess then, you would show me your

     pistol right quick an' shoot me

     dead, ain't that so?



              MUNNY

            (trapped)

     I... I guess I might... but like

     I said, I ain't armed.



Little Bill pulls out his pistol and points it at Munny and

makes a little motion with the barrel that means ""get up""

and Munny gets up.



Little Bill steps close to him and reaches out with his left

hand and opens Munny's coat revealing the Starr tucked in

his belt.



           LITTLE BILL

     I guess you just carry it for

     snakes an' such.



              MUNNY

     Uh... yeah.  Yeah.



           LITTLE BILL

             (cold)

     There ain't no snakes in here,

     Mister Hendershot.



              MUNNY

     Well, uh... it ain't loaded.



Little Bill takes the pistol out of Munny's belt and slowly

and deliberately ejects five cartridges and he looks at

Munny who is sweating and Munny just wants a way out.



              MUNNY

     Well, the powder's wet an...



WHACK!  Little Bill brings the muzzle of the gun across

Munny's temple and blood flows and Munny goes to one knee

and Little Bill kicks him hard, WHUMP!



           LITTLE BILL

          (turning to WW)

     Mister Beauchamp, this here is

     the sort of trash I was speakin'

     of.



Munny is struggling to his feet and staggering weak-kneed to

the table where he grabs the whiskey bottle and breaks it

off and turns groggily to face Little Bill.



Little Bill, unperturbed, advances on him and when Munny

strikes desperately with the bottle, Little Bill blocks his

blow easily and slams him hard with the muzzle of the pistol

and Munny goes down again.



           LITTLE BILL

             (to WW)

     You will find these kind in the

     saloons of your prosperous

     communities.

            (WHUMP, he kicks Munny)

     But you will not find none of

     them in Big Whiskey.



Munny is on the floor on all fours, trying gamely to get up.","A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, led by Strawberry Alice, offer a $1,000 reward to whoever can kill Quick Mike and ""Davey-Boy"" Bunting, two cowboys who disfigured Delilah Fitzgerald, one of their own.
The local sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, a former gunfighter and keeper of the peace, is worried about their incentive, as he does not allow guns or criminals in his town.
Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime.

Miles away in Kansas, the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man, visits the pig farm of William Munny, seeking to recruit him to kill the cowboys.
In his youth, Munny was a bandit notorious as a cold-blooded murderer.
Now a repentant widower raising two children, he has sworn off alcohol and killing.
Though Munny initially refuses to help with the execution, his farm is failing, putting his children's future in jeopardy.
Munny reconsiders a few days later and sets off to catch up with the Kid.
On his way, Munny recruits Ned Logan, another retired gunfighter, who reluctantly leaves his wife to go along.

Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob and his biographer, W. W. Beauchamp, arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward.
Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob, and Bill beats him savagely, hoping to discourage other would-be killers.
The next morning he ejects Bob from town, but Beauchamp decides to stay and write about Bill.
He has impressed the biographer with his tales of old gunfights and seeming knowledge of the inner workings of a gunfighter's psyche.

Munny, Logan and the Kid arrive later during a rain storm; they go to the saloon/whorehouse to discover the cowboys' location.
With a bad fever after riding in the rain, Munny is sitting alone in the saloon when Little Bill and his deputies arrive to confront him.
With no idea of Munny's past, Little Bill beats him and kicks him out of the saloon after finding a pistol on him.
Logan and the Kid, upstairs getting ""advances"" on their payment from the prostitutes, escape out a back window.
The three regroup at a barn outside of town, where they nurse Munny back to health.

Three days later, they ambush a group of cowboys and kill Bunting.
Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder.
Logan decides to return home while Munny and the Kid head to the cowboys' ranch, where the Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him.
After they escape, a distraught Kid confesses he had never killed anyone before.
He renounces life as a gunfighter.

When Little Sue meets the two men to give them the reward, they learn that Logan was captured by Little Bill's men and tortured to death.
He revealed the names of his two accomplices.
The Kid heads back to Kansas to deliver the reward money to Munny and Logan's families.
Munny drinks a little whisky from Ned's bottle and heads into town to take revenge on Bill.

That night, Logan's corpse is displayed in a coffin outside the saloon.
Inside, Little Bill has assembled a posse to pursue Munny and the Kid.
Munny walks in alone and kills Skinny Dubois, the saloon owner and pimp.
After some tense dialogue, a gunfight ensues, leaving Bill wounded and several of his deputies dead.
Munny orders everyone out before stopping Little Bill from reaching for his pistol.
Bill curses Munny before the latter finishes him with a final gunshot.
Munny threatens the townsfolk before finally leaving town, warning that he will return if Logan is not buried properly or if any prostitutes are further harmed.

A brief epilogue states that Munny was rumored to have moved to San Francisco, where he prospered in dry goods.","BAR ROOM - NIGHT 54

CLOSE on Ned's face, nose bloodied, eye blackened, as he

rides down the Main Street of Big Whiskey escorted by six

cowboys (including Texas Slim, Johnny Foley and Lippy

MacGregor) and Clyde and Andy.  Ned's wrists are tied and he

looks sullen and... scared.



Little Bill and WW Beauchamp are standing on the porch of

the County Office when the little group pulls up attended by

numerous onlookers.  Little Bill looks Ned over coolly as he

addresses Clyde.



           LITTLE BILL

     He tell you where them others is?



              CLYDE

     Nope.



           LITTLE BILL

     He give 'em names?



              CLYDE

     Didn't give us nothin' but his

     own name... Ned Roundtree.



           LITTLE BILL

     Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me

     an' Mister Beauchamp here all

     about them two villainous friends

     of yours, I guess.

          (to Clyde and Andy)

     Bring him in, boys, for I will be

     glad to know the names and the

     whereabouts of those other two

     murdering sonsofbitches."
22340,Unforgiven,"INT. SOD HUT - DAY 8



Munny selects a tin cup from a wash pan of dirty dishes.  It

is dark and cool inside his one room sod hut... and poor.



The Kid checks one of the three chairs for stability before

sitting down.



              MUNNY

     You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh?

     Hell, I thought maybe you was

     someone come to kill me...

             (he has the cups and

            he crosses to the fire)

     ...for somethin' I done in the

     old days.



             THE KID

            (sitting)

     I could of... easy.



              MUNNY

     Yeah, I guess so.



             THE KID

     Like I was sayin' you don't look

     like no meaner than hell cold-

     blooded damn killer.



              MUNNY

     Maybe I ain't.



             THE KID

     Well, Uncle Pete said you was the

     goddamndest meanest sonofabitch

     ever lived an' if I ever wanted a

     partner for a killin', you was the

     worst one.  Meanin' the best.  On

     account of you're cold as snow an'

     don't have no weak nerve nor fear.



Munny serves the coffee gloomily and sits down.  It appears

his feelings are hurt but The Kid doesn't notices.



              MUNNY

     He said that, huh?



             THE KID

     I'm a damn killer myself, only I

     ain't killed so many as you because

     of my youth.  Schofield Kid, they

     call me.



              MUNNY

     Schofield?  You from Schofield?



             THE KID

          (laying his Smith & Wesson

          Schofield .45 on the table)

     On account of my Schofield model

     Smith and Wesson pistol.



              MUNNY

     Oh.



             THE KID

     Well, how about it?



              MUNNY

     About what?



             THE KID

     Bein' my partner.   I'm headin' North

     up around the Niobrara in Nebraska.

     Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.



              MUNNY

     What for?



             THE KID

     For cuttin' up a lady.   They cut up

     her face an' cut her eyes out, cut

     her ears off an' her tits too.



              MUNNY

           (horrified)

     Jesus!



             THE KID

           (pleased with the

            reaction)

     Thousand dollars of reward.  Five

     hundred a piece.



              WILL

     Paw, I can't move that damn pig.



Will has slipped into the house with Penny in tow and they

are both covered with mud and Will is swearing toshow off

to the stranger.



              MUNNY

          (embarrassed)

     No cussin' now, Will.   Go on out

     the pump an' clean up some an' I'll

     be along.   Check them other pens.



The two kids back out the door, eyes on the pistol and the

stranger, and Munny walks over near the beds with his back

to The Kid.



              MUNNY

     I ain't like that no more, Kid.

     Whiskey done it as much as anythin'

     I guess.

          (turning to The Kid)

     I ain't touched a drop in ten years.

     My wife, she cured me of it...

     cured me of drink an' wickedness.



             THE KID

     Well... you don't look so prosper-

     ous.  Hell, you could buy her a new

     dress out of your half.  We could

     kill them two an' you could buy

     your wife one of them fancy...



              MUNNY

     She's passed on, Kid.



             THE KID

     Huh?



              MUNNY

     Been gone near three years now.



             THE KID

          (staring stupidly)

     Oh.","A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, led by Strawberry Alice, offer a $1,000 reward to whoever can kill Quick Mike and ""Davey-Boy"" Bunting, two cowboys who disfigured Delilah Fitzgerald, one of their own.
The local sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, a former gunfighter and keeper of the peace, is worried about their incentive, as he does not allow guns or criminals in his town.
Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime.

Miles away in Kansas, the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man, visits the pig farm of William Munny, seeking to recruit him to kill the cowboys.
In his youth, Munny was a bandit notorious as a cold-blooded murderer.
Now a repentant widower raising two children, he has sworn off alcohol and killing.
Though Munny initially refuses to help with the execution, his farm is failing, putting his children's future in jeopardy.
Munny reconsiders a few days later and sets off to catch up with the Kid.
On his way, Munny recruits Ned Logan, another retired gunfighter, who reluctantly leaves his wife to go along.

Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob and his biographer, W. W. Beauchamp, arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward.
Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob, and Bill beats him savagely, hoping to discourage other would-be killers.
The next morning he ejects Bob from town, but Beauchamp decides to stay and write about Bill.
He has impressed the biographer with his tales of old gunfights and seeming knowledge of the inner workings of a gunfighter's psyche.

Munny, Logan and the Kid arrive later during a rain storm; they go to the saloon/whorehouse to discover the cowboys' location.
With a bad fever after riding in the rain, Munny is sitting alone in the saloon when Little Bill and his deputies arrive to confront him.
With no idea of Munny's past, Little Bill beats him and kicks him out of the saloon after finding a pistol on him.
Logan and the Kid, upstairs getting ""advances"" on their payment from the prostitutes, escape out a back window.
The three regroup at a barn outside of town, where they nurse Munny back to health.

Three days later, they ambush a group of cowboys and kill Bunting.
Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder.
Logan decides to return home while Munny and the Kid head to the cowboys' ranch, where the Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him.
After they escape, a distraught Kid confesses he had never killed anyone before.
He renounces life as a gunfighter.

When Little Sue meets the two men to give them the reward, they learn that Logan was captured by Little Bill's men and tortured to death.
He revealed the names of his two accomplices.
The Kid heads back to Kansas to deliver the reward money to Munny and Logan's families.
Munny drinks a little whisky from Ned's bottle and heads into town to take revenge on Bill.

That night, Logan's corpse is displayed in a coffin outside the saloon.
Inside, Little Bill has assembled a posse to pursue Munny and the Kid.
Munny walks in alone and kills Skinny Dubois, the saloon owner and pimp.
After some tense dialogue, a gunfight ensues, leaving Bill wounded and several of his deputies dead.
Munny orders everyone out before stopping Little Bill from reaching for his pistol.
Bill curses Munny before the latter finishes him with a final gunshot.
Munny threatens the townsfolk before finally leaving town, warning that he will return if Logan is not buried properly or if any prostitutes are further harmed.

22380,Soldier (1998 American film),"INT.  ""STATION"" - DAY 35



     The huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN, CHURCH, RUBRICK,

     and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD.  Still dripping vet, the

     muscular MELTON is standing beside MEKUM, breathing heavily but

     not desperately.



                                   MEKUM

                    Of course, age is a factor, but the

                    real factor is the training program,

                    especially the psychological.  The

                    mind controls the body after all,

                    and we're doing wonderful things

                    with the mind.



     A shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off, moves closer,

     takes the form of a runner running.  It's TODD, still moving at

     the same pace, his face like stone.



     TODD lopes into the big warehouse and, breathing hard but evenly, 

     comes to a halt in front of RUBRICK and salutes.



                                   TODD

                    Sir.



                                   RUBRICK

                    At ease, soldier.



     CHURCH has been thinking and now he speaks to MEKUM.



                                   CHURCH

                    What's the price of all that speed?

                    Is he tired?

                                   MEKUM

                    Tired?



                                   CHURCH

                    Todd here ran the pace he's been

                    taught to run.  He's still strong.

                    Send him up the chain, Rube.



                                   RUBRICK

                         (to Todd)

                    Soldier!  Up the chain!

                                   TODD

                    Sir.



     TODD salutes and lopes toward ten chains that dangle from the

     rafters sixty feet above, grabs one, and starts up it, hand over

     hand.



     MEKUM watches TODD climb, then looks at CHURCH who is looking at

     him expectantly.



     MEKUM grins at CHURCH.



     Then MEKUM looks back at TODD, not hurrying.



     TODD is thirty feet up and climbing, passing the eight inch

     circular ""platforms"" or footholds in the chain every ten feet.

                                   MEKUM

                         (sharply)

                    Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!



                                   MELTON

                         (saluting)

                    Sir!



     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid-

     stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.



     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men

     struggle upward toward the rafters.



     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then

     passes him.

     MEKUM, watching, smirks.



     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow

     is knit, something's bothering him.



     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS



     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a ""platform"" on the chain, sixty

     feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.



     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a

     ""platform"" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.



     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up,

     three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches,

     neither man reveals anything at all...



     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP



     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.



                                   CHURCH

                    What about...spirit?



                                   MEKUM

                         (as in ""what's that?"")

                    Spirit?

                         (...a grin)

                    Oh!  You mean ""AQ""...""aggressive

                    qualities""?



                                   CHURCH

                    Whatever the latest jargon is.



                                   MEKUM

                    Much better, much higher.  For

                    example, where your old ones

                    expressed ninety percent of their

                    sexual energy in aggressive

                    physicality, these new ones are

                    ninety-nine percent without

                    sexual inclination.  It's all

                    aggression.



                                   SLOAN

                         (dryly)

                    Real men!



                                   CHURCH

                         (sharply, to Sloan)

                    At ease, Lieutenant.

                         (turning to Mekum,

                          serious)

                    What if they fought?



     A sudden silence.



     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.



     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up.

                                   MEKUM

                    You mean up there?



                                   CHURCH

                         (to Rubrick)

                    Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take

                    him.

                                   MEKUM

                    No!



     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new 

     soldiers can't fight?



                                   CHURCH

                    ""No""?

                                   MEKUM

                    Not fair.  No contest.  Send two

                    more of your old ones up.



     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a

     glance.



                                   MEKUM

                    Go ahead.



     RUBRICK shrugs, turns to the VETERANS still sitting stoically in

     a group on the cement floor.



                                   RUBRICK

                    Romero, A. -- Goines, D.L. -- up

                    the chains.



     Two of the veterans, ROMERO and GOINES, leap immediately to their

     feet and climb rapidly.



     SLOAN, CHURCH, and RUBRICK exchange a look as MEKUM smirks 

     confidently.



     ANGLE ON TODD AND MELTON ABOVE.  They're still facing each other

     across the sixty foot drop.



     MELTON glances down...without losing sight of TODD.



     ROMERO and GOINES are coming up the chains fast, hand over hand. 

     They're within ten feet, their impassive faces look dangerous.



     Nothing shows on MELTON's machine-face, but he starts a slight

     motion in his chain so that he spins slowly.  That way, as the 

     veterans surround him, he keeps a continual eye an all three.



     TODD, his face impassive, eyes MELTON vigilantly.



     ANGLE ON RUBRICK BELOW



     For a long moment, RUBRICK looks up at the three men dangling

     around the new soldier, then he shouts loudly at them.

                                   RUBRICK

                    Get him, men!



     ANGLE ON TODD as SMASH!  TODD is hit hard in the face even as he

     starts to swing.  WHAM!  MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his

     grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches,

     slides...



     ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, hit as he swings at MELTON.  WHAM!

     MELTON hits him again, hard.



     GOINES swings against MELTON from behind, smashing at him with

     his free hand and with both feet.



     MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the

     face with one hand, yanks the face close to his own, and squeezes 

     mercilessly.



     ANGLE ON TODD, TWENTY FEET BELOW.  He's managed to get a foothold

     on one of the mini-platforms.  His face horribly bloody, he looks

     up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly

     hurl ROMERO downward.



     ROMERO rockets down past TODD...



     ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH!  ROMERO's body crunches against the 

     cement not far from RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH, splattering them

     with blood.



     Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up

     again...



     ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who's

     been clubbing him from behind...GOINES!

     GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON, eyes merciless, deadly, 

     swings after him.



     ANGLE ON TODD, bloody, struggling up the chain hand over hand.

     His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and

     swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES.



     Just then, GOINES lunges at MELTON, SMACK, SMASH, he hits him

     hard, and WHAM!  MELTON hits him back...



     ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a ""platform"" foothold on his

     chain five feet above the swinging fighters.  TODD looks down

     on MELTON's back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing,

     then...



     TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON's back, crooking one

     arm around the new soldier's neck and pounding him with one free

     hand and strangling him with the other arm.



     MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face.



     ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW.  For the first time a frown of

     concern wrinkles his brow.



     ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders.

     MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD's ribs hard and TODD gasps

     for air, but...



     GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON's balls and...



     MELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips

     him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward

     even as...



     TODD goes for face with his free hand.



     SLAM!  MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow.



     TODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON's eyes.



     ANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of

     MELTON's injury.



     ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank

     impassive faces, RILEY among them.



     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like.



     ANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD.  SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  MELTON's

     elbows drive back into TODD's ribs.  The breath knocked out of

     him, TODD gasps for air, pain contorting his face.



     MELTON manages to get TODD's forearm into his mouth and bites 

     furiously, drawing blood.



     TODD grits his teeth in pain.



     WHAM!  Another blow to the ribs from MELTON's elbow.



     TODD is losing his grip.



     RILEY watches below, his face a mask.



     MELTON bites and elbows furiously.



     TODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON, rakes flesh as he begins

     to fall and then...



     Plunging downward, TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it

     ...but he keeps falling, the chain ripping flesh from his hand

     for twenty feet until...



     He can't hold on any longer!  TODD plunges the last thirty feet

     to the floor, landing with a terrible crunch right on top of

     ROMERO's broken body below.



     Sudden silence!



     ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies

     motionless, sprawled on ROMERO's body.



     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings.



     ANGLE ON CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken.



     It's MEKUM who breaks the silence, SCREAMING furiously at the one-

     eyed MELTON who's still sixty feet up...

                                   MEKUM

                    GET DOWN HERE!  GET DOWN HERE ON THE

                    DOUBLE, GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE, YOU

                    MISERABLE PISS ANT STINKING SHIT FOR

                    BRAINS!



     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK lift their stunned faces from TODD to

     MEKUM who's continuing to rant at MELTON as MELTON comes down the

     chain fast...

                                   MELTON

                    COME ON, DOUBLE IT UP, DOWN, DOWN,

                    DOWN, YOU MISERABLE THIRD RATE

                    SHITHEAD INCOMPETENT CLOWN!



     MELTON lets go of the chain and drops the last fifteen feet,

     landing gracefully on his feet in front of MEKUM and salutes.



                                   MELTON

                    Sir!



                                   MEKUM

                    LOOK AT YOU, YOU BIG DUMB SHIT,

                    YOU'VE LOST AN EYE.  WHAT THE HELL

                    GOOD IS A GODDAMN ONE-EYED SOLDIER?

                    YOU, YOU BIG MORON?  TO TRAIN YOU,

                    FEED YOU?



     As MEKUM turns, including all the NEW SOLDIERS in his continuing

     tirade, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK confer in low voices.



                                   RUBRICK

                    They're...fantastic!

                         (worried)

                    We could have a problem here,

                    couldn't we?  I mean, we just lost

                    three men...



                                   CHURCH

                    Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

                    ""Training accident.""  Paperwork.



                                   SLOAN

                         (turning away)

                    Incinerator.



     Turning his back on SLOAN and RUBRICK, CHURCH approaches MEKUM

     who's still raging, indicating MELTON to the blank-faced NEW

     SOLDIERS.



                                   MEKUM

                    WHAT GOOD IS THIS MAN NOW?  WITH ONE

                    Yeah, well, the big moron shouldn't

                    have lost an eye.



     CHURCH glances at TODD's corpse dumped over ROMERO's broken body,

     tries to assuage him.



                                   CHURCH

                    It was our best man who got his

                    eye...  Todd, a real tough one.

                    Survived police action in Montana,

                    fought in the Argentine Sector, and

                    in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing

                    of --

                    Wait until you get these new fellas

                    into some real action.  I guarantee

                    you'll be awed.  I guarantee it.



     The NEW SOLDIERS sit impassively, the bleeding MELTON among them,

     staring right at the VETERANS.



     Not far away three dead bodies lie motionless as we...

Undergoing extreme mental and physical training, they become virtual sociopaths, extremely disciplined, but with no understanding of anything except military routine and war.
The soldiers are conditioned to never speak unless spoken to, to completely ignore physical pain, and to address whomever they are speaking to (women included) as ""sir"".

At the age of 49, Sgt.
Todd 3465 (Kurt Russell) is a hardened veteran of many battles, but his unit is about to be replaced.
Colonel Mekum (Jason Isaacs) introduces a new group of genetically engineered soldiers, designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotion, except aggression.

Todd's unit's commander, Captain Church (Gary Busey) insists on testing the ""new"" soldiers' abilities against his own.
But Todd, the unit's best soldier, is no match for Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee).
In the final trial, a fight between Caine and three ""old"" soldiers, two of Todd's comrades are killed, though Todd manages to gouge out one of Caine's eyes before he is defeated.
Todd seemingly dies when he falls from a great height; but the body of a dead soldier cushions his fall, and he is simply knocked unconscious.
Mekum orders their bodies dumped like garbage, and the remaining ""old"" soldiers are demoted to menial support roles.
Meanwhile Caine gets an artificial blue eye to replace the brown eye he lost.

Todd and his dead comrades are dumped on the surface of Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet with dangerously high winds.
Though badly injured, Todd limps toward a colony of humans who crash-landed there twelve years earlier, and have managed to survive and build a society from the planet's mountains of trash.

Though they try to make him welcome, Todd has difficulty adapting to the community due to his extreme conditioning and their extreme pacifism.
Todd's training, and subsequently stunted social skills, make it difficult for him to answer in anything more than curt replies.
Many of the settlers are afraid of him, but he is accepted and sheltered by Mace (Sean Pertwee) and his wife Sandra (Connie Nielsen).
Todd develops a silent rapport with their mute son, Nathan (Jared and Taylor Throne), who had been traumatized by a snakebite earlier in his life.
In a later conflict with a coiled snake, Todd teaches Nathan how to face it down and strike back to protect himself.
His parents misinterpret the lesson, unsure of how to deal with Todd.

However, Todd soon begins to experience flashbacks from his time as a soldier and mistakes one of the pacifist colonists (Michael Chiklis) for an enemy, nearly killing him.
The pacifists decide that Todd is too dangerous to live among them, so they give him supplies and democratically vote him out of the colony.
Outside the colony, he sheds tears, but appears confused, implying that this is the first time in his life that he has ever cried.

A short time later, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by another snake while sleeping, but are saved by Nathan, who used Todd's technique.
Mace then realizes that Todd taught their son how to protect his parents from the snakes.
He also realizes that Todd has an important role to play in their community, and decides to search for the soldier on his own and bring him back.
The colonists object, saying that they had voted him out democratically, but Mace insists that ""We voted wrong.""

The new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on the garbage planet for a training exercise.
Since the world is listed as uninhabited, Colonel Mekum decides that the pacifists' presence is unlawful and, for practice, orders his troops to slaughter them.
Frightened children hide underground and hope not to be seen.
Mace is spotted by the troops and killed just after he finds Todd.
Though outmanned and outgunned, Todd's years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad attacking the pacifists.

Nervous that an unknown enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery.
Using guerilla tactics, Todd outmaneuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers, including Caine 607, who is defeated in hand-to-hand combat.

Panicking, Mekum orders the transport ship's crew, composed of Todd's old squad, to set up and activate a portable nuclear device powerful enough to destroy the planet, then orders the ship to lift off, leaving the squad behind.
When Captain Church objects, Mekum shoots him in cold blood.
Before they can take off as planned, Todd appears, and his old comrades recognize him as the ranking officer due to their conditioning and silently side with him over the army that has discarded them.
Todd and his comrades take over the ship, leaving Mekum and his aides on the planet, then evacuate the remaining colonists just before the bomb detonates.
Mekum wets his pants as he realizes he is helpless.

Todd orders the ship to set course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists' original destination, then picks up Nathan and points to their new destination, while looking out upon the galaxy.","""STATION"" - DAY 35



     The huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN, CHURCH, RUBRICK,

     and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD. CHURCH has been thinking and now he speaks to MEKUM. RUBRICK

                         (to Todd)

                    You mean up there? MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his

     grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches,

     slides...



     ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up

     again...



     ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who's

     been clubbing him from behind...GOINES! His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and

     swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES. TODD looks down

     on MELTON's back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing,

     then...



     TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON's back, crooking one

     arm around the new soldier's neck and pounding him with one free

     hand and strangling him with the other arm. MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow. ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings. Turning his back on SLOAN and RUBRICK, CHURCH approaches MEKUM

     moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons

     that aren't clear.



     Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up.



     In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of

     a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him

     from the wind howling overhead.



     TODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he

     slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and 

     injured even to crawl.



     Lying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly

     wind, their waists dangling with weapons and equipment, big

     rocket rifles across their chests.  They're looking ahead toward

     the long cable, as their nasty-looking vehicle grinds slowly

     forward through the litter, an evil vision."

     Bursting into the corridor, SANDRA sees ELLEN racing toward her, 

     weaving through broken beams, SCREAMING as CAINE 607 lumbers

     after her out of the shadows.  CAINE 607 doesn't bother to avoid 

     obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg.

                   Sergeant Todd!



     ELLEN dives into SANDRA's arms and SANDRA turns, only three steps

     ahead of CAINE 607, and rushes into the meeting room.","In the near future, as part of a new military training program (""Project Adam""), a group of infants are selected at birth and raised as soldiers.
Undergoing extreme mental and physical training, they become virtual sociopaths, extremely disciplined, but with no understanding of anything except military routine and war.
The soldiers are conditioned to never speak unless spoken to, to completely ignore physical pain, and to address whomever they are speaking to (women included) as ""sir"".

At the age of 49, Sgt.
Todd 3465 (Kurt Russell) is a hardened veteran of many battles, but his unit is about to be replaced.
Colonel Mekum (Jason Isaacs) introduces a new group of genetically engineered soldiers, designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotion, except aggression.

Todd's unit's commander, Captain Church (Gary Busey) insists on testing the ""new"" soldiers' abilities against his own.
But Todd, the unit's best soldier, is no match for Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee).
In the final trial, a fight between Caine and three ""old"" soldiers, two of Todd's comrades are killed, though Todd manages to gouge out one of Caine's eyes before he is defeated.
Todd seemingly dies when he falls from a great height; but the body of a dead soldier cushions his fall, and he is simply knocked unconscious.
Mekum orders their bodies dumped like garbage, and the remaining ""old"" soldiers are demoted to menial support roles.
Meanwhile Caine gets an artificial blue eye to replace the brown eye he lost.

Todd and his dead comrades are dumped on the surface of Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet with dangerously high winds.
Though badly injured, Todd limps toward a colony of humans who crash-landed there twelve years earlier, and have managed to survive and build a society from the planet's mountains of trash.

Though they try to make him welcome, Todd has difficulty adapting to the community due to his extreme conditioning and their extreme pacifism.
Todd's training, and subsequently stunted social skills, make it difficult for him to answer in anything more than curt replies.
Many of the settlers are afraid of him, but he is accepted and sheltered by Mace (Sean Pertwee) and his wife Sandra (Connie Nielsen).
Todd develops a silent rapport with their mute son, Nathan (Jared and Taylor Throne), who had been traumatized by a snakebite earlier in his life.
In a later conflict with a coiled snake, Todd teaches Nathan how to face it down and strike back to protect himself.
His parents misinterpret the lesson, unsure of how to deal with Todd.

However, Todd soon begins to experience flashbacks from his time as a soldier and mistakes one of the pacifist colonists (Michael Chiklis) for an enemy, nearly killing him.
The pacifists decide that Todd is too dangerous to live among them, so they give him supplies and democratically vote him out of the colony.
Outside the colony, he sheds tears, but appears confused, implying that this is the first time in his life that he has ever cried.

A short time later, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by another snake while sleeping, but are saved by Nathan, who used Todd's technique.
Mace then realizes that Todd taught their son how to protect his parents from the snakes.
He also realizes that Todd has an important role to play in their community, and decides to search for the soldier on his own and bring him back.
The colonists object, saying that they had voted him out democratically, but Mace insists that ""We voted wrong.""

The new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on the garbage planet for a training exercise.
Since the world is listed as uninhabited, Colonel Mekum decides that the pacifists' presence is unlawful and, for practice, orders his troops to slaughter them.
Frightened children hide underground and hope not to be seen.
Mace is spotted by the troops and killed just after he finds Todd.
Though outmanned and outgunned, Todd's years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad attacking the pacifists.

Nervous that an unknown enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery.
Using guerilla tactics, Todd outmaneuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers, including Caine 607, who is defeated in hand-to-hand combat.

Panicking, Mekum orders the transport ship's crew, composed of Todd's old squad, to set up and activate a portable nuclear device powerful enough to destroy the planet, then orders the ship to lift off, leaving the squad behind.
When Captain Church objects, Mekum shoots him in cold blood.
Before they can take off as planned, Todd appears, and his old comrades recognize him as the ranking officer due to their conditioning and silently side with him over the army that has discarded them.
Todd and his comrades take over the ship, leaving Mekum and his aides on the planet, then evacuate the remaining colonists just before the bomb detonates.
Mekum wets his pants as he realizes he is helpless.

Todd orders the ship to set course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists' original destination, then picks up Nathan and points to their new destination, while looking out upon the galaxy.","INT.  CORRIDOR 206

          You remember Zoe.

          Right, hi.



And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.

          Wow.

                 (then, to Stan)

          Wow.



At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It

says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

          What is that supposed to mean?



                    OLIVIA

     1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                  22.","Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.
Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the police code for homicide) on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks.
The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.

Fifteen months after surviving from the ordeal, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a rowdy, unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of ""Kappin' Off Suckers"" (K.O.S.).
Their leader, Benito ""Benny"" Chacón, a menacing felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.

The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats.
Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but which is stymied by Garfield's diffident and destabilizing behavior, likely arising from post-traumatic stress disorder and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past also garners him the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, a burned-out, alcoholic history teacher who carries and keeps guns at the school.

After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he inexplicably disappears, and Benny's severely unstable tag partner, César, takes over as leader and class antagonist.

     window where the boys play a rough game of BASKETBALL.



                                ELLEN

     Trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf,

                  No thanks.



     She watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.

                  So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny...

                  and if the district construes it

                  as assault and battery on a

                  student, she's gone.

                  Now I get to see him every day in

                  homeroom. I'm stuck with him.

                  Condition of his probation is

                  that he stay in school.

                  a conference, but she refuses to

                  show up. She's afraid they'll

                  deport her because she's illegal.

                  So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and

                  some attorney tells her she

                  doesn't have to come in.

                  Garcia got cold feet and dropped

                  the whole thing.

                  This kid's threatening me and all

                  he's worried about is a lawsuit.

                  That he wanted to hurt me.   Real

                  weeks ago, my car was broken into...

                  And last Friday, I think he was

                  You didn't.



     OFF Trevor's severe gaze...","Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.
Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the police code for homicide) on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks.
The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.

Fifteen months after surviving from the ordeal, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a rowdy, unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of ""Kappin' Off Suckers"" (K.O.S.).
Their leader, Benito ""Benny"" Chacón, a menacing felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.

The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats.
Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but which is stymied by Garfield's diffident and destabilizing behavior, likely arising from post-traumatic stress disorder and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past also garners him the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, a burned-out, alcoholic history teacher who carries and keeps guns at the school.

After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he inexplicably disappears, and Benny's severely unstable tag partner, César, takes over as leader and class antagonist.
The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S.
escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog.
César, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dog with a ""dead"" face, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow.
He passes out, and wakes up to find one of his fingers cut off.
César later recovers the finger and it is reattached, though the letters ""R U DUN"" (""are you done?"")
have been tattooed onto it as a warning.

A student Garfield has tutored, a Chicana by the name of Rita Martínez, faces continuing abuse from both the K.O.S.
and Childress, and drops out.
The school administration is hopelessly mired in bureaucracy and unable to intervene.
After Benny is found dead in the Los Angeles River, apparently of a drug overdose, it becomes clear that Garfield has taken justice into his own hands, playing by the rules of the street in an intense contest with César and the K.O.S.

The K.O.S.
plan to murder Garfield after they accuse him of killing Benny and amputating César's finger.
The conflict comes to a head at Garfield's house, as the gang forces Garfield into a contest of Russian roulette with César (who gets the idea from watching The Deer Hunter).
The latter's resolve is finally shaken, as Garfield gets through to him about the lost-cause lifestyle he has led, saying ""Your whole way of life is bullshit.
Macho is bullshit."".
Hesitating at his turn, César watches as Garfield, offering to take his turn for him, takes the revolver and shoots himself in the head.
Driven by his personal sense of honor and ignoring the protests of his horrified friends, César insists on taking his rightful turn and ends up killing himself in the same manner as his teacher.

Later on graduation day, Rita, who returns and completes her studies along with former K.O.S.
member Stevie, offers a tribute to Garfield by reading an essay about him at commencement.
The essay incorporates the theme of the Pyrrhic victory, which Garfield had once explained to her in a tutoring session.
The film ends on a somber note as Ellen, presumably disheartened at the incident, appears to leave the school (she throws her teaching certificate into a garbage bin).","BUNGALOW #86 - CLOSE ON VENETIAN BLINDS - LATER           38

                  ... Oh, my God.



     Trevor and Ellen, propelled now toward the alley, hearts

     pounding, frantically rushing toward the conclusion as

     the flashlight traces the length of the chain...

                           (right behind Trevor)

                  Jack?!



     The chain disappears over the top of the alley wall.

     Trevor kicks open the alley gate and freezes.","Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.
Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the police code for homicide) on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks.
The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.

Fifteen months after surviving from the ordeal, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a rowdy, unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of ""Kappin' Off Suckers"" (K.O.S.).
Their leader, Benito ""Benny"" Chacón, a menacing felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.

The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats.
Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but which is stymied by Garfield's diffident and destabilizing behavior, likely arising from post-traumatic stress disorder and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past also garners him the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, a burned-out, alcoholic history teacher who carries and keeps guns at the school.

After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he inexplicably disappears, and Benny's severely unstable tag partner, César, takes over as leader and class antagonist.
The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S.
escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog.
César, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dog with a ""dead"" face, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow.
He passes out, and wakes up to find one of his fingers cut off.
César later recovers the finger and it is reattached, though the letters ""R U DUN"" (""are you done?"")
have been tattooed onto it as a warning.

A student Garfield has tutored, a Chicana by the name of Rita Martínez, faces continuing abuse from both the K.O.S.
and Childress, and drops out.
The school administration is hopelessly mired in bureaucracy and unable to intervene.
After Benny is found dead in the Los Angeles River, apparently of a drug overdose, it becomes clear that Garfield has taken justice into his own hands, playing by the rules of the street in an intense contest with César and the K.O.S.

The K.O.S.
plan to murder Garfield after they accuse him of killing Benny and amputating César's finger.
The conflict comes to a head at Garfield's house, as the gang forces Garfield into a contest of Russian roulette with César (who gets the idea from watching The Deer Hunter).
The latter's resolve is finally shaken, as Garfield gets through to him about the lost-cause lifestyle he has led, saying ""Your whole way of life is bullshit.
Macho is bullshit."".
Hesitating at his turn, César watches as Garfield, offering to take his turn for him, takes the revolver and shoots himself in the head.
Driven by his personal sense of honor and ignoring the protests of his horrified friends, César insists on taking his rightful turn and ends up killing himself in the same manner as his teacher.

Later on graduation day, Rita, who returns and completes her studies along with former K.O.S.
member Stevie, offers a tribute to Garfield by reading an essay about him at commencement.
The essay incorporates the theme of the Pyrrhic victory, which Garfield had once explained to her in a tutoring session.
The film ends on a somber note as Ellen, presumably disheartened at the incident, appears to leave the school (she throws her teaching certificate into a garbage bin).","89   EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - RAMBLER - CONTINUOUS           89

      Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun

      disappear over the horizon. He can hear DOOR OPENING and

      someone moving in his house.

      his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.

                  You killed Benny. And you cut off

      ANOTHER ANGLE



      In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room

      table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the

      other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets

      into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

      as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.



                                 CESAR

                   You gon' do yourself, mayate.

      Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

      his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

      He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

      A crazed, watery glint in his eye.

       He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.

                    ... Let's get outta here.



       Paco pulls at Cesar, who's staring at Trevor's dead body.

                    I gotta do this.

       He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish,

       Not knowing himself, Paco stumbles out of Trevor's

       kitchen toward the back door. Finally Stevie follows

       him as we PULL BACK to reveal the crumpled bodies of

       Trevor and Cesar lying on the floor.



                                  NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

                    ... Last night tragedy struck in

                    North Hollywood where a high

                    school teacher and one of his

                    students were both found shot

                    to death inside the teacher's home.



       V.O. continues through the...



       1   8   7 - Rev. 9/4/96                                   122A.","Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.
Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the police code for homicide) on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks.
The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.

Fifteen months after surviving from the ordeal, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a rowdy, unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of ""Kappin' Off Suckers"" (K.O.S.).
Their leader, Benito ""Benny"" Chacón, a menacing felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.

The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats.
Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but which is stymied by Garfield's diffident and destabilizing behavior, likely arising from post-traumatic stress disorder and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past also garners him the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, a burned-out, alcoholic history teacher who carries and keeps guns at the school.

After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he inexplicably disappears, and Benny's severely unstable tag partner, César, takes over as leader and class antagonist.
The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S.
escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog.
César, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dog with a ""dead"" face, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow.
He passes out, and wakes up to find one of his fingers cut off.
César later recovers the finger and it is reattached, though the letters ""R U DUN"" (""are you done?"")
have been tattooed onto it as a warning.

A student Garfield has tutored, a Chicana by the name of Rita Martínez, faces continuing abuse from both the K.O.S.
and Childress, and drops out.
The school administration is hopelessly mired in bureaucracy and unable to intervene.
After Benny is found dead in the Los Angeles River, apparently of a drug overdose, it becomes clear that Garfield has taken justice into his own hands, playing by the rules of the street in an intense contest with César and the K.O.S.

The K.O.S.
plan to murder Garfield after they accuse him of killing Benny and amputating César's finger.
The conflict comes to a head at Garfield's house, as the gang forces Garfield into a contest of Russian roulette with César (who gets the idea from watching The Deer Hunter).
The latter's resolve is finally shaken, as Garfield gets through to him about the lost-cause lifestyle he has led, saying ""Your whole way of life is bullshit.
Macho is bullshit."".
Hesitating at his turn, César watches as Garfield, offering to take his turn for him, takes the revolver and shoots himself in the head.
Driven by his personal sense of honor and ignoring the protests of his horrified friends, César insists on taking his rightful turn and ends up killing himself in the same manner as his teacher.

Later on graduation day, Rita, who returns and completes her studies along with former K.O.S.
member Stevie, offers a tribute to Garfield by reading an essay about him at commencement.
The essay incorporates the theme of the Pyrrhic victory, which Garfield had once explained to her in a tutoring session.
The film ends on a somber note as Ellen, presumably disheartened at the incident, appears to leave the school (she throws her teaching certificate into a garbage bin).","TREVOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - EVENING                 151

      disappear over the horizon. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

      the living room -- an act of intimidation. Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching. Opens a

      fist to reveal six bullets. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

      as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him. CESAR

     Trevor flicks on the lights, exposing bare, colorless

     walls and closed venetian blinds. His breathing's

     slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase. His back

     faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes

     a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. Almost instantly his

     breathing returns to normal.



     Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the

     dormant enthusiasm he used to have. Takes a deep

     cathartic breath. Now he digs a file folder out of his

     briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches

     the blackboard.



     BELL RINGS as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins.

     First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard.

     Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins

     to write per the file folder in his hand...



     ""GLIS WAS VERY FRAPPER.    SHE HAD DENARPEN FARFIE'S

     MARDSEN...""



     No one pays much attention.    Back still facing the

     Childress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's

     shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds.

                 See, you zigged when you shoulda

     Childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing

     another bungalow across the way.","Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.
Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the police code for homicide) on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks.
The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.

Fifteen months after surviving from the ordeal, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a rowdy, unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of ""Kappin' Off Suckers"" (K.O.S.).
Their leader, Benito ""Benny"" Chacón, a menacing felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.

The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats.
Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but which is stymied by Garfield's diffident and destabilizing behavior, likely arising from post-traumatic stress disorder and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past also garners him the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, a burned-out, alcoholic history teacher who carries and keeps guns at the school.

After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he inexplicably disappears, and Benny's severely unstable tag partner, César, takes over as leader and class antagonist.
The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S.
escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog.
César, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dog with a ""dead"" face, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow.
He passes out, and wakes up to find one of his fingers cut off.
César later recovers the finger and it is reattached, though the letters ""R U DUN"" (""are you done?"")
have been tattooed onto it as a warning.

A student Garfield has tutored, a Chicana by the name of Rita Martínez, faces continuing abuse from both the K.O.S.
and Childress, and drops out.
The school administration is hopelessly mired in bureaucracy and unable to intervene.
After Benny is found dead in the Los Angeles River, apparently of a drug overdose, it becomes clear that Garfield has taken justice into his own hands, playing by the rules of the street in an intense contest with César and the K.O.S.

The K.O.S.
plan to murder Garfield after they accuse him of killing Benny and amputating César's finger.
The conflict comes to a head at Garfield's house, as the gang forces Garfield into a contest of Russian roulette with César (who gets the idea from watching The Deer Hunter).
The latter's resolve is finally shaken, as Garfield gets through to him about the lost-cause lifestyle he has led, saying ""Your whole way of life is bullshit.
Macho is bullshit."".
Hesitating at his turn, César watches as Garfield, offering to take his turn for him, takes the revolver and shoots himself in the head.
Driven by his personal sense of honor and ignoring the protests of his horrified friends, César insists on taking his rightful turn and ends up killing himself in the same manner as his teacher.

Later on graduation day, Rita, who returns and completes her studies along with former K.O.S.
member Stevie, offers a tribute to Garfield by reading an essay about him at commencement.
The essay incorporates the theme of the Pyrrhic victory, which Garfield had once explained to her in a tutoring session.
The film ends on a somber note as Ellen, presumably disheartened at the incident, appears to leave the school (she throws her teaching certificate into a garbage bin).","BUNGALOW ""84"" - MORNING                                   30

            It's a 25 mile stretch of road -

            gets an average of 20 feet of snow

            during the winter, and there's just

            no way to make it economically

            feasible to keep it clear.  When

            the place was built in 1907, there

            was very little interest in winter

            sports, and this site was chosen

            for its seclusion and scenic beauty.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:","Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel to interview for the position of winter caretaker, with the aim of using the hotel's solitude to work on his writing.
The hotel itself is built on the site of a Native American burial ground and becomes completely snowed in during the long winters.
Manager Stuart Ullman warns him that a previous caretaker developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself.
Jack's son, Danny, appears to have ESP and has had a terrifying premonition about the hotel.
Jack's wife, Wendy, tells a visiting doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he had hurt Danny's arm following a binge.

The family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour.
The African-American chef Dick Hallorann surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream.
He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls ""shining"".
Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237.
Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel itself has a ""shine"" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good.
He also tells Danny to stay out of Room 237.

A month passes; while Jack's writing project goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze.
Wendy becomes concerned about the phone lines being out due to the heavy snowfall and Danny has more frightening visions.
Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts acting strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts.

Danny's curiosity about Room 237 gets the better of him when he sees the room's door open.
Later, Wendy finds Jack, asleep at his typewriter, screaming while in the midst of a horrifying nightmare.
After she awakens him, he says he dreamed that he had killed her and Danny.
Danny then shows up with a bruise on his neck and visibly traumatized, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing Danny.
Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd.
Lloyd serves him bourbon on the rocks while Jack complains to him about his marriage.

Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her that a ""crazy woman in one of the rooms"" tried to strangle him.
Jack investigates Room 237, where he encounters the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy he saw nothing.
Wendy and Jack argue about whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts having a costume party.
Here, he meets the ghost of the previous caretaker, Grady, who tells Jack that he must ""correct"" his wife and child, and that Danny has reached out to Hallorann somehow.

Meanwhile, in Florida, Hallorann has a premonition that something is wrong at the hotel and takes a flight back to Colorado to investigate.
Danny starts calling out ""redrum"" frantically and goes into a trance, now referring to himself as ""Tony"".

While searching for Jack, Wendy discovers his typewriter; he has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" in different layouts.
She is confronted by Jack, who threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat.
She manages to drag him into the kitchen and lock him in the pantry, but this does not solve her larger problem; she and Danny are trapped at the hotel since Jack has sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat.
Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who then unlocks the door, releasing him.

Danny writes ""REDЯUM"" in lipstick on the bathroom door.
When Wendy sees this in the bedroom mirror, the letters spell out ""MURDƎЯ"".
Jack begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters with a fire axe.
Wendy frantically sends Danny out through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to fit through it herself.
Jack then starts chopping through the bathroom door as Wendy screams in horror.
He leers through the hole he has made, shouting ""Here's Johnny!
"", but backs off after Wendy slashes his hand with a butcher knife.

Hearing the engine of the snowcat Hallorann has borrowed to get up the mountain, Jack leaves the room.
He kills Hallorann in the lobby and pursues Danny into the hedge maze.
Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering several ghosts and a huge cascade of blood from an elevator.
Meanwhile, Danny walks backwards in his own tracks and leaps behind a corner, covering his tracks with snow to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints.
Wendy and Danny escape in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death in the hedge maze.

            boy, my grandmother and I could

            hold conversations entirely without

            ever opening our mouths.  She

            called it shining,

            was just the two of us that had the

A MONTH LATER



                                            CUT TO:","Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel to interview for the position of winter caretaker, with the aim of using the hotel's solitude to work on his writing.
The hotel itself is built on the site of a Native American burial ground and becomes completely snowed in during the long winters.
Manager Stuart Ullman warns him that a previous caretaker developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself.
Jack's son, Danny, appears to have ESP and has had a terrifying premonition about the hotel.
Jack's wife, Wendy, tells a visiting doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he had hurt Danny's arm following a binge.

The family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour.
The African-American chef Dick Hallorann surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream.
He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls ""shining"".
Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237.
Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel itself has a ""shine"" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good.
He also tells Danny to stay out of Room 237.

A month passes; while Jack's writing project goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze.
Wendy becomes concerned about the phone lines being out due to the heavy snowfall and Danny has more frightening visions.
Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts acting strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts.

Danny's curiosity about Room 237 gets the better of him when he sees the room's door open.
Later, Wendy finds Jack, asleep at his typewriter, screaming while in the midst of a horrifying nightmare.
After she awakens him, he says he dreamed that he had killed her and Danny.
Danny then shows up with a bruise on his neck and visibly traumatized, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing Danny.
Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd.
Lloyd serves him bourbon on the rocks while Jack complains to him about his marriage.

Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her that a ""crazy woman in one of the rooms"" tried to strangle him.
Jack investigates Room 237, where he encounters the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy he saw nothing.
Wendy and Jack argue about whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts having a costume party.
Here, he meets the ghost of the previous caretaker, Grady, who tells Jack that he must ""correct"" his wife and child, and that Danny has reached out to Hallorann somehow.

Meanwhile, in Florida, Hallorann has a premonition that something is wrong at the hotel and takes a flight back to Colorado to investigate.
Danny starts calling out ""redrum"" frantically and goes into a trance, now referring to himself as ""Tony"".

While searching for Jack, Wendy discovers his typewriter; he has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" in different layouts.
She is confronted by Jack, who threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat.
She manages to drag him into the kitchen and lock him in the pantry, but this does not solve her larger problem; she and Danny are trapped at the hotel since Jack has sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat.
Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who then unlocks the door, releasing him.

Danny writes ""REDЯUM"" in lipstick on the bathroom door.
When Wendy sees this in the bedroom mirror, the letters spell out ""MURDƎЯ"".
Jack begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters with a fire axe.
Wendy frantically sends Danny out through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to fit through it herself.
Jack then starts chopping through the bathroom door as Wendy screams in horror.
He leers through the hole he has made, shouting ""Here's Johnny!
"", but backs off after Wendy slashes his hand with a butcher knife.

Hearing the engine of the snowcat Hallorann has borrowed to get up the mountain, Jack leaves the room.
He kills Hallorann in the lobby and pursues Danny into the hedge maze.
Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering several ghosts and a huge cascade of blood from an elevator.
Meanwhile, Danny walks backwards in his own tracks and leaps behind a corner, covering his tracks with snow to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints.
Wendy and Danny escape in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death in the hedge maze.

            get up off the floor.



WENDY puts hand under his arm and he starts to rise.



                                            CUT TO:","Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel to interview for the position of winter caretaker, with the aim of using the hotel's solitude to work on his writing.
The hotel itself is built on the site of a Native American burial ground and becomes completely snowed in during the long winters.
Manager Stuart Ullman warns him that a previous caretaker developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself.
Jack's son, Danny, appears to have ESP and has had a terrifying premonition about the hotel.
Jack's wife, Wendy, tells a visiting doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he had hurt Danny's arm following a binge.

The family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour.
The African-American chef Dick Hallorann surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream.
He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls ""shining"".
Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237.
Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel itself has a ""shine"" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good.
He also tells Danny to stay out of Room 237.

A month passes; while Jack's writing project goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze.
Wendy becomes concerned about the phone lines being out due to the heavy snowfall and Danny has more frightening visions.
Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts acting strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts.

Danny's curiosity about Room 237 gets the better of him when he sees the room's door open.
Later, Wendy finds Jack, asleep at his typewriter, screaming while in the midst of a horrifying nightmare.
After she awakens him, he says he dreamed that he had killed her and Danny.
Danny then shows up with a bruise on his neck and visibly traumatized, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing Danny.
Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd.
Lloyd serves him bourbon on the rocks while Jack complains to him about his marriage.

Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her that a ""crazy woman in one of the rooms"" tried to strangle him.
Jack investigates Room 237, where he encounters the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy he saw nothing.
Wendy and Jack argue about whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts having a costume party.
Here, he meets the ghost of the previous caretaker, Grady, who tells Jack that he must ""correct"" his wife and child, and that Danny has reached out to Hallorann somehow.

Meanwhile, in Florida, Hallorann has a premonition that something is wrong at the hotel and takes a flight back to Colorado to investigate.
Danny starts calling out ""redrum"" frantically and goes into a trance, now referring to himself as ""Tony"".

While searching for Jack, Wendy discovers his typewriter; he has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" in different layouts.
She is confronted by Jack, who threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat.
She manages to drag him into the kitchen and lock him in the pantry, but this does not solve her larger problem; she and Danny are trapped at the hotel since Jack has sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat.
Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who then unlocks the door, releasing him.

Danny writes ""REDЯUM"" in lipstick on the bathroom door.
When Wendy sees this in the bedroom mirror, the letters spell out ""MURDƎЯ"".
Jack begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters with a fire axe.
Wendy frantically sends Danny out through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to fit through it herself.
Jack then starts chopping through the bathroom door as Wendy screams in horror.
He leers through the hole he has made, shouting ""Here's Johnny!
"", but backs off after Wendy slashes his hand with a butcher knife.

Hearing the engine of the snowcat Hallorann has borrowed to get up the mountain, Jack leaves the room.
He kills Hallorann in the lobby and pursues Danny into the hedge maze.
Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering several ghosts and a huge cascade of blood from an elevator.
Meanwhile, Danny walks backwards in his own tracks and leaps behind a corner, covering his tracks with snow to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints.
Wendy and Danny escape in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death in the hedge maze.

He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls ""shining"".
Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237.
Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel itself has a ""shine"" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good.
He also tells Danny to stay out of Room 237.

A month passes; while Jack's writing project goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze.
Wendy becomes concerned about the phone lines being out due to the heavy snowfall and Danny has more frightening visions.

Danny's curiosity about Room 237 gets the better of him when he sees the room's door open.

Danny then shows up with a bruise on his neck and visibly traumatized, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing Danny.

Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her that a ""crazy woman in one of the rooms"" tried to strangle him.
Jack investigates Room 237, where he encounters the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy he saw nothing.
Wendy and Jack argue about whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts having a costume party.
Here, he meets the ghost of the previous caretaker, Grady, who tells Jack that he must ""correct"" his wife and child, and that Danny has reached out to Hallorann somehow.

She is confronted by Jack, who threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat.

                  now. And I say no. Piss off,

                  you.



     Salim huddles down in the pipe. After a while, Jamal

     follows suit.



                                SALIM (CONT'D)

                  We don't even know what the

                  third musketeer's called.","In Mumbai in 2006, eighteen-year-old Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a former street child (child Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, adolescent Tanay Chheda) from the Juhu slum, is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and is one question away from the grand prize.
However, before the Rs.
20 million question, he is detained and interrogated by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple ""slumdog"" with very little education knowing all the answers.
Jamal recounts, through flashbacks, the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer.
These flashbacks tell the story of Jamal, his brother Salim (adult Madhur Mittal, adolescent Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, child Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), and Latika (adult Freida Pinto, adolescent Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, child Rubina Ali).
In each flashback Jamal has a point to remember one person, or song, or different things that lead to the right answer of one of the questions.
The row of questions does not correspond chronologically to Jamal's life, so the story switches between different periods (childhood, adolescence) of Jamal.
Some questions do not refer to points of his life (cricket champion), but by witness he comes to the right answer.

Jamal's flashbacks begin with his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, which his brother then sells, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the Bombay Riots.
As they flee the riot, they run into a child version of the God Rama, Salim and Jamal then meet Latika, another child from their slum.
Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the third musketeer, a character from the Alexandre Dumas novel (which they had been studying — albeit not very diligently — in school), whose name they do not know.
The three are found by Maman (Ankur Vikal), a gangster who tricks and then trains street children into becoming beggars.
When Jamal, Salim, and Latika learn Maman is blinding children in order to make them more effective as singing beggars, they flee by jumping onto a departing train.
Latika catches up and takes Salim's hand, but Salim purposely lets go, and she is recaptured by the gangsters.
Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they steal people's shoes.
At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering from Arvind, one of the singing beggars, that she has been raised by Maman to become a prostitute and that her virginity is expected to fetch a high price.
The brothers rescue her, and Salim draws a gun and kills Maman.
Salim then manages to get a job with Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar), Maman's rival crime lord.
Arriving at their hotel room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone.
When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Jamal leaves after Latika persuades him to go away (presumably so he wouldn't get hurt by Salim).

Years later, while working as a tea server at an Indian call centre, Jamal searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika.
He fails in finding Latika but succeeds in finding Salim, who is now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization, and they reunite.
Salim is regretful for his past actions and only pleads for forgiveness when Jamal physically attacks him.
Jamal then bluffs his way into Javed's residence and reunites with Latika.
While Jamal professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her.
Jamal promises to wait for her every day at 5 o'clock at the VT station.
Latika attempts to rendezvous with him, but she is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim.
Jamal loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house, outside of Mumbai.
Knowing that Latika watches it regularly, Jamal attempts to make contact with her again by becoming a contestant on the show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
He makes it to the final question, despite the hostile attitude of the show's host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), and becomes a wonder across India.
Kumar feeds Jamal the incorrect response to the penultimate question and, when Jamal still gets it right, turns him into the police on suspicion of cheating.

Back in the interrogation room, the police inspector (Irrfan Khan) calls Jamal's explanation ""bizarrely plausible"", but thinks he is not a liar and, ripping up the arrest warrant, allows him to return to the show.
At Javed's safehouse, Latika watches the news coverage of Jamal's miraculous run on the show.
Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, quietly gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal.
Latika, though initially reluctant out of fear of Javed, agrees and escapes.
Salim fills a bathtub with cash and sits in it, waiting for the death he knows will come when Javed discovers what he has done.
Jamal's final question is, by coincidence, the name of the third musketeer in The Three Musketeers, a fact he never learned.
Jamal uses his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call Salim's cell, as it is the only phone number he knows.
Latika succeeds in answering the phone just in the nick of time, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe.
Relieved, Jamal randomly picks Aramis, the right answer, and wins the grand prize.
Simultaneously, Javed discovers that Salim has helped Latika escape after he hears Latika on the show.
He and his men break down the bathroom door, and Salim kills Javed, before being gunned down himself at the hands of Javed's men.
With his dying breath, Salim gasps, ""God is great.""
Later that night, Jamal and Latika meet at the railway station and kiss.
The movie ends with a dance scene on the platform to ""Jai Ho"".","34   INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.    33                             34

Jamal's flashbacks begin with his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, which his brother then sells, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the Bombay Riots.
As they flee the riot, they run into a child version of the God Rama, Salim and Jamal then meet Latika, another child from their slum.
Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the third musketeer, a character from the Alexandre Dumas novel (which they had been studying — albeit not very diligently — in school), whose name they do not know.
The three are found by Maman (Ankur Vikal), a gangster who tricks and then trains street children into becoming beggars.
When Jamal, Salim, and Latika learn Maman is blinding children in order to make them more effective as singing beggars, they flee by jumping onto a departing train.
Latika catches up and takes Salim's hand, but Salim purposely lets go, and she is recaptured by the gangsters.
Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they steal people's shoes.
At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering from Arvind, one of the singing beggars, that she has been raised by Maman to become a prostitute and that her virginity is expected to fetch a high price.
The brothers rescue her, and Salim draws a gun and kills Maman.
Salim then manages to get a job with Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar), Maman's rival crime lord.
Arriving at their hotel room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone.
When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Jamal leaves after Latika persuades him to go away (presumably so he wouldn't get hurt by Salim).

Years later, while working as a tea server at an Indian call centre, Jamal searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika.
He fails in finding Latika but succeeds in finding Salim, who is now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization, and they reunite.
Salim is regretful for his past actions and only pleads for forgiveness when Jamal physically attacks him.
Jamal then bluffs his way into Javed's residence and reunites with Latika.
While Jamal professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her.
Jamal promises to wait for her every day at 5 o'clock at the VT station.
Latika attempts to rendezvous with him, but she is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim.
Jamal loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house, outside of Mumbai.
Knowing that Latika watches it regularly, Jamal attempts to make contact with her again by becoming a contestant on the show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
He makes it to the final question, despite the hostile attitude of the show's host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), and becomes a wonder across India.
Kumar feeds Jamal the incorrect response to the penultimate question and, when Jamal still gets it right, turns him into the police on suspicion of cheating.

Back in the interrogation room, the police inspector (Irrfan Khan) calls Jamal's explanation ""bizarrely plausible"", but thinks he is not a liar and, ripping up the arrest warrant, allows him to return to the show.
At Javed's safehouse, Latika watches the news coverage of Jamal's miraculous run on the show.
Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, quietly gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal.
Latika, though initially reluctant out of fear of Javed, agrees and escapes.
Salim fills a bathtub with cash and sits in it, waiting for the death he knows will come when Javed discovers what he has done.
Jamal's final question is, by coincidence, the name of the third musketeer in The Three Musketeers, a fact he never learned.
Jamal uses his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call Salim's cell, as it is the only phone number he knows.
Latika succeeds in answering the phone just in the nick of time, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe.
Relieved, Jamal randomly picks Aramis, the right answer, and wins the grand prize.
Simultaneously, Javed discovers that Salim has helped Latika escape after he hears Latika on the show.
He and his men break down the bathroom door, and Salim kills Javed, before being gunned down himself at the hands of Javed's men.
With his dying breath, Salim gasps, ""God is great.""
Later that night, Jamal and Latika meet at the railway station and kiss.
The movie ends with a dance scene on the platform to ""Jai Ho"".","107   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.    109                             107

      As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps

      on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of

      course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches

      herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost

      delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the

      door, laughing."

However, before the Rs.
20 million question, he is detained and interrogated by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple ""slumdog"" with very little education knowing all the answers.
Jamal recounts, through flashbacks, the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer.
These flashbacks tell the story of Jamal, his brother Salim (adult Madhur Mittal, adolescent Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, child Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), and Latika (adult Freida Pinto, adolescent Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, child Rubina Ali).
In each flashback Jamal has a point to remember one person, or song, or different things that lead to the right answer of one of the questions.

                   don't know! In an amazing run,

                   Jamal has already five million

                   rupees but, not content with

                   that, has chosen to gamble for

                   million rupees. What a player!

                   The question one more time:

                   most first class centuries in

                   history. Was it A) Sachin

                Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.

                That leaves you a fifty-fifty

                choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting

                or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you

                think? Decision time. For half a

                million rupees. Your answer: B)

                time. You wouldn't dare miss it.

                Goodnight!



      Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off

      his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up

      and pulls out his mobile.","In Mumbai in 2006, eighteen-year-old Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a former street child (child Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, adolescent Tanay Chheda) from the Juhu slum, is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and is one question away from the grand prize.
However, before the Rs.
20 million question, he is detained and interrogated by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple ""slumdog"" with very little education knowing all the answers.
Jamal recounts, through flashbacks, the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer.
These flashbacks tell the story of Jamal, his brother Salim (adult Madhur Mittal, adolescent Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, child Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), and Latika (adult Freida Pinto, adolescent Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, child Rubina Ali).
In each flashback Jamal has a point to remember one person, or song, or different things that lead to the right answer of one of the questions.
The row of questions does not correspond chronologically to Jamal's life, so the story switches between different periods (childhood, adolescence) of Jamal.
Some questions do not refer to points of his life (cricket champion), but by witness he comes to the right answer.

Jamal's flashbacks begin with his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, which his brother then sells, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the Bombay Riots.
As they flee the riot, they run into a child version of the God Rama, Salim and Jamal then meet Latika, another child from their slum.
Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the third musketeer, a character from the Alexandre Dumas novel (which they had been studying — albeit not very diligently — in school), whose name they do not know.
The three are found by Maman (Ankur Vikal), a gangster who tricks and then trains street children into becoming beggars.
When Jamal, Salim, and Latika learn Maman is blinding children in order to make them more effective as singing beggars, they flee by jumping onto a departing train.
Latika catches up and takes Salim's hand, but Salim purposely lets go, and she is recaptured by the gangsters.
Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they steal people's shoes.
At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering from Arvind, one of the singing beggars, that she has been raised by Maman to become a prostitute and that her virginity is expected to fetch a high price.
The brothers rescue her, and Salim draws a gun and kills Maman.
Salim then manages to get a job with Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar), Maman's rival crime lord.
Arriving at their hotel room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone.
When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Jamal leaves after Latika persuades him to go away (presumably so he wouldn't get hurt by Salim).

Years later, while working as a tea server at an Indian call centre, Jamal searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika.
He fails in finding Latika but succeeds in finding Salim, who is now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization, and they reunite.
Salim is regretful for his past actions and only pleads for forgiveness when Jamal physically attacks him.
Jamal then bluffs his way into Javed's residence and reunites with Latika.
While Jamal professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her.
Jamal promises to wait for her every day at 5 o'clock at the VT station.
Latika attempts to rendezvous with him, but she is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim.
Jamal loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house, outside of Mumbai.
Knowing that Latika watches it regularly, Jamal attempts to make contact with her again by becoming a contestant on the show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
He makes it to the final question, despite the hostile attitude of the show's host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), and becomes a wonder across India.
Kumar feeds Jamal the incorrect response to the penultimate question and, when Jamal still gets it right, turns him into the police on suspicion of cheating.

Back in the interrogation room, the police inspector (Irrfan Khan) calls Jamal's explanation ""bizarrely plausible"", but thinks he is not a liar and, ripping up the arrest warrant, allows him to return to the show.
At Javed's safehouse, Latika watches the news coverage of Jamal's miraculous run on the show.
Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, quietly gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal.
Latika, though initially reluctant out of fear of Javed, agrees and escapes.
Salim fills a bathtub with cash and sits in it, waiting for the death he knows will come when Javed discovers what he has done.
Jamal's final question is, by coincidence, the name of the third musketeer in The Three Musketeers, a fact he never learned.
Jamal uses his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call Salim's cell, as it is the only phone number he knows.
Latika succeeds in answering the phone just in the nick of time, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe.
Relieved, Jamal randomly picks Aramis, the right answer, and wins the grand prize.
Simultaneously, Javed discovers that Salim has helped Latika escape after he hears Latika on the show.
He and his men break down the bathroom door, and Salim kills Javed, before being gunned down himself at the hands of Javed's men.
With his dying breath, Salim gasps, ""God is great.""
Later that night, Jamal and Latika meet at the railway station and kiss.
The movie ends with a dance scene on the platform to ""Jai Ho"".","151                                   148

       screaming.

                 He's a cheat.

                   Oh, come on! Of course he is.

                   He's a bloody village boy. Even

                   when I fed him the wrong answer

                   the little shit got it right.



      Director stares at him.



                                 DIRECTOR

                   You gave him an answer?



                                 PREM

                   Well, I didn't exactly-



      The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

      doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.



                                 PREM (CONT'D)

                   Nita?

      The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at

      the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like

      an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic

      on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,

      faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.","In Mumbai in 2006, eighteen-year-old Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a former street child (child Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, adolescent Tanay Chheda) from the Juhu slum, is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and is one question away from the grand prize.
However, before the Rs.
20 million question, he is detained and interrogated by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple ""slumdog"" with very little education knowing all the answers.
Jamal recounts, through flashbacks, the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer.
These flashbacks tell the story of Jamal, his brother Salim (adult Madhur Mittal, adolescent Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, child Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), and Latika (adult Freida Pinto, adolescent Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, child Rubina Ali).
In each flashback Jamal has a point to remember one person, or song, or different things that lead to the right answer of one of the questions.
The row of questions does not correspond chronologically to Jamal's life, so the story switches between different periods (childhood, adolescence) of Jamal.
Some questions do not refer to points of his life (cricket champion), but by witness he comes to the right answer.

Jamal's flashbacks begin with his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, which his brother then sells, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the Bombay Riots.
As they flee the riot, they run into a child version of the God Rama, Salim and Jamal then meet Latika, another child from their slum.
Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the third musketeer, a character from the Alexandre Dumas novel (which they had been studying — albeit not very diligently — in school), whose name they do not know.
The three are found by Maman (Ankur Vikal), a gangster who tricks and then trains street children into becoming beggars.
When Jamal, Salim, and Latika learn Maman is blinding children in order to make them more effective as singing beggars, they flee by jumping onto a departing train.
Latika catches up and takes Salim's hand, but Salim purposely lets go, and she is recaptured by the gangsters.
Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they steal people's shoes.
At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering from Arvind, one of the singing beggars, that she has been raised by Maman to become a prostitute and that her virginity is expected to fetch a high price.
The brothers rescue her, and Salim draws a gun and kills Maman.
Salim then manages to get a job with Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar), Maman's rival crime lord.
Arriving at their hotel room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone.
When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Jamal leaves after Latika persuades him to go away (presumably so he wouldn't get hurt by Salim).

Years later, while working as a tea server at an Indian call centre, Jamal searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika.
He fails in finding Latika but succeeds in finding Salim, who is now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization, and they reunite.
Salim is regretful for his past actions and only pleads for forgiveness when Jamal physically attacks him.
Jamal then bluffs his way into Javed's residence and reunites with Latika.
While Jamal professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her.
Jamal promises to wait for her every day at 5 o'clock at the VT station.
Latika attempts to rendezvous with him, but she is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim.
Jamal loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house, outside of Mumbai.
Knowing that Latika watches it regularly, Jamal attempts to make contact with her again by becoming a contestant on the show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
He makes it to the final question, despite the hostile attitude of the show's host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), and becomes a wonder across India.
Kumar feeds Jamal the incorrect response to the penultimate question and, when Jamal still gets it right, turns him into the police on suspicion of cheating.

Back in the interrogation room, the police inspector (Irrfan Khan) calls Jamal's explanation ""bizarrely plausible"", but thinks he is not a liar and, ripping up the arrest warrant, allows him to return to the show.
At Javed's safehouse, Latika watches the news coverage of Jamal's miraculous run on the show.
Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, quietly gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal.
Latika, though initially reluctant out of fear of Javed, agrees and escapes.
Salim fills a bathtub with cash and sits in it, waiting for the death he knows will come when Javed discovers what he has done.
Jamal's final question is, by coincidence, the name of the third musketeer in The Three Musketeers, a fact he never learned.
Jamal uses his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call Salim's cell, as it is the only phone number he knows.
Latika succeeds in answering the phone just in the nick of time, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe.
Relieved, Jamal randomly picks Aramis, the right answer, and wins the grand prize.
Simultaneously, Javed discovers that Salim has helped Latika escape after he hears Latika on the show.
He and his men break down the bathroom door, and Salim kills Javed, before being gunned down himself at the hands of Javed's men.
With his dying breath, Salim gasps, ""God is great.""
Later that night, Jamal and Latika meet at the railway station and kiss.
The movie ends with a dance scene on the platform to ""Jai Ho"".","191   INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.     193                         191

24005,The Breakfast Club,"6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY 6



     There are six tables in two rows of three.

     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in

     and sits at the table behind her.



     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire

     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.



     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout

     desk and takes a few things in the process.



     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to

     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian

     reluctantly gets up and moves.



     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his

     feet up.



     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the

     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind

     Brian.



     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.



     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.



     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack

     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with

     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the

     job.



                            VERNON

               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want

               to congradulate you for being on

               time...



     Claire raises her hand.



                            CLAIRE

               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's

               been a mistake.  I know it's

               detention, but...um...I don't think

               I belong in here...



     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.



                            VERNON

               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have

               exactly eight hours and fifty-four

               minutes to think about why you're

               here.  To ponder the error of your

               ways...



     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his

     mouth again.



     Claire looks like she is going to gag.



                            VERNON

               ...and you may not talk.  You will

               not move from these seats.



     He glances up at Bender and points at him.



                            VERNON

               ...and you...



     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.



                            VERNON

               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,

               we're gonna try something a little

               different today.  We are going to

               write an essay--of no less than a

               thousand words--describing to me

               who you think you are.



                            BENDER

               Is this a test?



     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice

     of Bender.



                            VERNON

               And when I say essay...I mean essay.

               I do not mean a single word repeated

               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.

               Bender?



     Bender looks up.



                            BENDER

               Crystal...



                            VERNON

               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little

               something about yourself.  Maybe

               you'll even--decide whether or not

               you care to return.



     Brian raises his hand and then stands.



                            BRIAN

               You know, I can answer that right

               now sir...That'd be ""No"", no for me.

               'cause...



                            VERNON

               Sit down Johnson...



                            BRIAN

               Thank you sir...



     He sits.



                            VERNON

               My office...



     Vernon points.



                            VERNON

               ...is right across that hall.  Any

               monkey business is ill-advised...



     He looks around at them.



                            VERNON

               ...any questions?



                            BENDER

               Yeah...I got a question.



     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.



                            BENDER

               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his

               wardrobe?



                            VERNON

               I'll give you the answer to that

               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

               Don't mess with the bull young man,

               you'll get the horns.



     Vernon leaves.



                            BENDER

               That man...is a brownie hound...



     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud

     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is

     Allison, biting her nails.



     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is

     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.



                            BENDER

               You keep eating your hand and you're

               not gonna be hungry for lunch...



     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.



                            BENDER

               I've seen you before, you know...



     We see Vernon look out from his office.



     We see Brian playing with his pen.



                            BRIAN

                    (quietly to himself)

               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?

               Who are you?



     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top

     under his upper lip.



                            BRIAN

               I am a walrus...



     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices

     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--

     embarrassed.



     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the

     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing

     his jacket.



     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands

     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket

     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still

     staring at him.



                            BRIAN

               It's the shits, huh?



     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable

     laugh.



     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He

     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's

     head.



     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore

     Bender.



     Bender starts loudly ""singing"" the musical part of a

     song.  “Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...”



                            CLAIRE

                    (to herself)

               I can't believe this is really

               happening to me...



     Bender stops ""singing"" abruptly.



                            BENDER

               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do

               if we hafta take a piss?



                            CLAIRE

                    (disgusted)

               Please...



                            BENDER

               If you gotta go...



     We hear Bender unzip his fly.



                            BENDER

               You gotta go!



     Everyone is now looking at Bender.



                            CLAIRE

                   (disgusted)

               Oh my God!



                            ANDREW

               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!



                            BENDER

               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes

               it crawl back up!



                            ANDREW

               You whip it out and you're dead

               before the first drop hits the

               floor!



     Bender gasps mockingly.



                            BENDER

               You're pretty sexy when you get

               angry...grrr!



     He turns to Brian.



                            BENDER

               Hey, homeboy...



     Brian points at himself with his pen.



                            BENDER

              ...why don't you go close that door.

               We'll get the prom queen--

               impregnated!



     Claire turns and glares at him.



                            ANDREW

               Hey!



     Bender ignores him.



                            ANDREW

               Hey!

                          BENDER

               What?



                            ANDREW

               If I lose my temper, you're totalled

               man!



                            BENDER

                            CLAIRE

                    (to Bender)

               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody

               here is interested!



                            ANDREW

               Really!

                    (to Claire about Bender)

               Buttface!



                            BENDER

               Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to

               get in here?  Forget to wash your

               jock?



                            BRIAN

                    (nervous)

               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we

               should just write our papers...



                            ANDREW

                    (to Bender)

               Look, just because you live in here

               doesn't give you the right to be a

               pain in the ass...so knock it off!



     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.



                            BENDER

               It's a free country...



                            CLAIRE

               He's just doing it to get a rise out

               you tried!



     Claire rolls her eyes.

               So...so!

                    (to Andrew and Claire)

               you slip her the hot...beef...

               injection?



     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.

                                                  CUT TO:","On March 24, 1984, five students — ""criminal"" John Bender, ""athlete"" Andrew Clark, ""brain"" Brian Johnson, ""basket case"" Allison Reynolds, and ""princess"" Claire Standish — report for Saturday morning detention at Shermer High School in the Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois.
While not complete strangers, each of them comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common.
They gather in the high school library where they are instructed by the assistant principal, Richard Vernon, not to speak, move from their seats, or sleep for a period of eight hours, fifty-four minutes (from 7:06 AM to 4 PM).
He assigns a 1,000-word essay to the students in which each must write about who he or she is.
He then leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them.
Bender, who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon, disregards the rules and constantly riles the other students, mocking Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire.
Allison is initially quiet except for the occasional random outburst.

The students pass the hours by arguing and smoking marijuana that Bender retrieves from his locker.
Gradually, they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar, Andrew hates his father, John comes from an abusive household, Brian has contemplated suicide, and Claire is a virgin.
They discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents and are afraid of making the same mistakes as the adults around them.
However, despite these developing friendships, the students are afraid that once the detention is over, they will return to their very different cliques and never speak to each other again.

Towards the end of the day, the other students ask Brian to write the essay that Vernon assigned earlier.
Brian does so, but instead of writing about the assigned topic, he writes a letter objecting to Vernon's request to describe who they are, stating that the man has already judged who they are (an athlete, basket case, princess, brain, and criminal), and that he will not accept any different accounts from them.
Brian signs the essay as ""The Breakfast Club"" and leaves it at the table for Vernon to read after they leave.
Before the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John.","LIBRARY - DAY 6



     There are six tables in two rows of three. In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout

     desk and takes a few things in the process. Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his

     feet up. I think there's

               been a mistake. To ponder the error of your

               ways...



     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his

     mouth again. VERNON

               ...and you may not talk. VERNON

               And when I say essay...I mean essay. Is that clear Mr.

               Bender? Maybe you'll learn a little

               something about yourself. Maybe

               you'll even--decide whether or not

               you care to return. VERNON

               My office...



     Vernon points. BENDER

               That man...is a brownie hound...



     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud

     snapping sound. He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top

     under his upper lip. Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore

     Bender. What're we s'posed to do

               if we hafta take a piss? We'll get the prom queen--

               impregnated! CLAIRE

                    (to Bender)

               Why don't you just shut up! (to Claire about Bender)

               Buttface! What'd you do to

               get in here? I think we

               should just write our papers...



                            ANDREW

                    (to Bender)

               Look, just because you live in here

               doesn't give you the right to be a

               pain in the ass...so knock it off! BENDER

               It's a free country...



                            CLAIRE

                    (to Andrew)

               He's just doing it to get a rise out

               of you! (another beat)

               Come on Sporto, level with me. CLAIRE

                    (screams)

               Go to hell! ANDREW

                    (screams)

               Enough!"

     Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself.



                            VERNON

               Coffee...looks like they scrape it

               off the bottom of the Mississippi

               river.  Everything's polluted,

               everything's polluted...the coffee.



     Bender comes out of the library doors followed

     bye veryone else.



     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.

     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the

     end of the line, Allison is following.



                            CLAIRE

                    (to Bender)

               How do you know where Vernon went?



                            BENDER

               I don't...



                            CLAIRE

               Well then, how do you know when he'll

               be back?



                            BENDER

               I don't...being bad feels pretty

               good, huh?



                            BRIAN

                    (to Andrew)

               What's the point in going to Bender's

               locker?



                            ANDREW

               Beats me...



                            BRIAN

               This is so stupid...Why do you think,

               why are we risking getting caught?



                            ANDREW

               I dunno...



                            BRIAN

               So then what are we doing?



                            ANDREW

               You ask me one more question and I'm

               beating the shit out of you!



                            BRIAN

               Sorry...



     Bender opens his locker.



                            ANDREW

               Slob!



                            BENDER

               My maid's on vacation.



     Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana.



                            BRIAN

               Drugs...



                            ANDREW

              Screw that Bender...put it back!



     Bender walks away.



                         BRIAN

               Drugs...the boy had marijuana.



     Claire walks after Bender.



                            BRIAN

               That was marijuana!



                            ANDREW

               Shut up!



     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison

     who is standing there with her mouth open.



                            BRIAN

               Do you approve of this?



     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of

     Bender's locker.



     We see the crowd walking down the hall.



                            BENDER

               We'll cross through the lab, and

               then we'll double back.



                            ANDREW

               You better be right, if Vernon cuts

               us off it's your fault, asshole!



                            BRIAN

                    (to Claire)

               What'd he say?  Where're we going?



     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various

     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon

     until they stop.



                            BENDER

               Wait!  Wait, hold it!  Hold it!  We

               have to go through the cafeteria!



                            ANDREW

               No, the activities hall.



                            BENDER

               Hey man, you don't know what you're

               talking about!



                            ANDREW

               No you don't know what you're

               talking about!



     Allison squeaks.



                            ANDREW

               Now we're through listening to you,

               we're going this way.



     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by

     an iron gate.



                            ANDREW

               Shit!



                            BENDER

               Great idea Jagoff!



                            ANDREW

               Fuck you!



                            CLAIRE

                    (to Andrew)

               Fuck you!  Why didn't you listen to

               John?



                            BRIAN

               We're dead!



                            BENDER

               No, just me!



                            BRIAN

               What do you mean?



                            BENDER

               Get back to the library, keep your

               unit on this!



     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's

     underwear.



     Bender runs away singing loudly.  “I wanna be an

     airborne ranger...”



     We see Vernon hear Bender.



     The rest of them run.



                            VERNON

               That son of a bitch!



     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in

     the gym.



     Bender is going up for a basket.



                            BENDER

               Three...two...one!



     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.



                            VERNON

               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is

               this?  What are you doing here, what

               is this?



                            BENDER

               Oh, hi!



                            VERNON

               Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's

               over!



                            BENDER

               Don't you wanna hear my excuse?



                            VERNON

               Out!



                            BENDER

               I'm thinking of trying out for a

               scholarship.



                            VERNON

               Gimmie the ball, Bender.



     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball

     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.



     They leave.

                            CLAIRE

               He's an adult!



     Allison is relishing this attention.



                           ALLISON

               Yeah...he's married too!



     Claire notes her disgust.



                            CLAIRE

               Do you have any idea how completely

               gross that is?



                           ALLISON

               Well, the first few times...



                            CLAIRE

               First few times?  You mean he did it

               more than once?



                           ALLISON

               Sure...



                            CLAIRE

               Are you crazy?



                            BRIAN

               Obviously she's crazy if she's

               screwing her shrink...



                           ALLISON

                    (to Claire)

               Have you ever done it?



                            CLAIRE

               I don't even have a psychiatrist...



                           ALLISON

               Have you ever done it with a normal

               person?



                            CLAIRE

               Now, didn't we already cover this?



                            BENDER

               You never answered the question...



                            CLAIRE

               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my

               private life with total strangers.



                           ALLISON

               It's kind of a double-edged sword,

               isn't it?



                            CLAIRE

               A what?



                           ALLISON

               Well, if you say you haven't...

               you're a prude.  If you say you

               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

               You want to but you can't but when

               you do you wish you didn't, right?



                            CLAIRE

               Wrong...



                           ALLISON

               Or, are you a tease?



                            ANDREW

               She's a tease...



                            CLAIRE

               Oh why don't you just forget it...



                            ANDREW

               You're a tease and you know it, all

               girls are teases!



                            BENDER

                    (to Andrew)

               She's only a tease if what she does

               gets you hot...



                            CLAIRE

               I don't do anything!



                           ALLISON

               That's why you're a tease...



                            CLAIRE

               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.



     Allison is suddenly defensive.



                           ALLISON

               I've already told you everything!



                            CLAIRE

               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

               around without being in love.  I

               mean don't you want any respect?



                           ALLISON

               I don't screw to get respect...That's

               the difference between you and me...



                            CLAIRE

               Not the only difference, I hope.



                            BENDER

               Face it, you're a tease.



                            CLAIRE

               I'm not a tease!



                            BENDER

               Sure you are!  You said it yourself

               sex is a weapon, you use it to get

               respect!



                            CLAIRE

               No, I never said that, she twisted

               my words around.



                            BENDER

               Oh then what do you use it for?



                            CLAIRE

               I don't use it period!



     Claire is on the verge of tears.



                            BENDER

               Oh, are you medically frigid or is

               it psychological?



                            CLAIRE

               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

               are putting words into my mouth!



                            BENDER

               Well if you'd just answer the

               question...



                            BRIAN

               Why don't you just answer the

               question?



                            ANDREW

               Be honest...



                            BENDER

               No big deal...



                            BRIAN

               Yeah, answer it!



                            ANDREW

               Answer the question, Claire!



                            BENDER

               Talk to us!



                       ANDREW & BRIAN

               Come on, answer the question!



                            BENDER

               It's easy, it's only one question!



     Claire silences all of them by screaming.



                            CLAIRE

                    (screaming)

               No!  I never did it!



     Silence for two beats.



                           ALLISON

               I never did it either, I'm not a

               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

               liar...



                            CLAIRE

               You are such a bitch!  You did that

               on purpose just to fuck me over!



                           ALLISON

               I would do it though...If you love

               someone it's okay...



                            CLAIRE

               I can't believe you, you're so

               weird.  You don't say anything all

               day and then when you open your

               mouth...you unload all these

               tremendous lies all over me!



                            ANDREW

               You're just pissed off because she

               got you to admit something you didn't

               want to admit to...



                            CLAIRE

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...



                            ANDREW

               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

               better at hiding it, that's all.



                            CLAIRE

                    (to Andrew)

               How are you bizarre?



     Allison decides to field that question.



                           ALLISON

               He can't think for himself...



                            ANDREW

               She's right...do you guys know what,

               uh, what I did to get in here?  I

               taped Larry Lester's buns together.



     Claire laughs.



                            BRIAN

                    (to Andrew)

               That was you?



                           ANDREW

                    (to Brian)

               Yeah, you know him?



                            BRIAN

               Yeah, I know him...



                            ANDREW

               Well then you know how hairy he is,

               right?  Well, when they pulled the

               tape off, most of his hair came off

               and some, some skin too...



                            CLAIRE

               Oh my God...



                            ANDREW

               And the bizarre thing is, is that

               I did it for my old man...I

               tortured this poor kid, because I

               wanted him to think that I was cool.

               He's always going off about, you

               know, when he was in school...all

               the wild things he used to do.  And

               I got the feeling that he was

               disappointed that I never cut loose

               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

               sitting in the locker room, and I'm

               taping up my knee.  And Larry's

               undressing a couple lockers down

               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness.

               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

               jumped on top of him and started

               wailing on him...And my friends,

               they just laughed and cheered me on.

               And afterwards, when I was sittin'

               in Vernon's office, all I could

               think about was Larry's father. And

               Larry havin' to go home and...and

               explain what happened to him.  And

               the humiliation...fucking

               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

               mustuv been unreal...I mean,

                    (he's crying)

               I mean, how do you apologize for

               something like that?  There's no

               way...it's all because of me and

               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

               him!  He's like this...he's like

               this mindless machine that I can't

               even relate to anymore...""Andrew,

               you've got to be number one!  I

               won't tolerate any losers in this

               family...Your intensity is for shit!

               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!""  You son of a

               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

               my knee would give...and I wouldn't

               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

               could forget all about me...



                            BENDER

               I think your old man and my old man

               should get together and go bowling.



     Andrew laughs briefly.



                            BRIAN

               It's like me, you know, with my

               grades...like, when I, when I

               step outside myself kinda, and

               when I, when I look in at myself

               you know?  And I see me and I don't

               like what I see, I really don't.



                            CLAIRE

               What's wrong with you?  Why don't

               you like yourself?



                            BRIAN

               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

               shop.  See we had this assignment,

               to make this ceramic elephant, and

               um...and we had eight weeks to do

               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

               like a lamp, and when you pull the

               trunk the light was s'posed to go

               on...my light didn't go on, I got a

               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

               When I signed up, you know, for the

               course I mean.  I thought I was

               playing it real smart, you know.

               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

               it'll be such an easy way to

               maintain my grade point average...



                            BENDER

               Why'd you think it'd be easy?



                            BRIAN

               Have you seen some of the dopes that

               take shop?



                            BENDER

               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

               idiot!



                            BRIAN

               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

               make a lamp?



                            BENDER

               No, you're a genius because you

               can't make a lamp...



                            BRIAN

               What do you know about Trigonometry?



                            BENDER

               I could care less about

               Trigonometry...



                            BRIAN

               Bender, did you know without

               Trigonometry there'd be no

               engineering?



                            BENDER

               Without lamps, there'd be no light!



                            CLAIRE

              Okay so neither one of you is any

               better than the other one...



     Allison feels left out.



                           ALLISON

               I can write with my toes!  I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...



                            CLAIRE

               With your feet?



                           ALLISON

               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.



                            BRIAN

               I can make spaghetti!



                            CLAIRE

                    (to Andrew)

               What can you do?



                            ANDREW

               I can...uh...tape all your buns

               together...



                            BENDER

               I wanna see what Claire can do!



                            CLAIRE

               I can't do anything.



                            BENDER

               Now, everybody can do something...



                            CLAIRE

               There's one thing I can do, no

               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.



                            BENDER

               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

               that guy's been doing that show for

               thirty years.



                            CLAIRE

               Okay, but you have to swear to God

               you won't laugh...I can't believe

               I'm actually doing this...



     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it

     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.



     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.



      Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.



                            ANDREW

               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

               to do that?



                            CLAIRE

               Camp, seventh grade...



                            BENDER

               That was great, Claire...my image of

               you is totally blown...



                           ALLISON

               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!



                            BENDER

               Am I laughing?



                            ANDREW

               You fucking prick!



     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his

     words hitting home.



                            BENDER

               What do you care what I think,

               anyway?  I don't even count, right?

               I could disappear forever and it

               wouldn't make any difference...I may

               as well not even exist at this

               school, remember?

                    (he turns to Claire)

               And you...don't like me anyway!



                            CLAIRE

               You know, I have just as many

               feelings as you do and it hurts

               just as much when somebody steps

               all over them!



                            BENDER

               God, you're so pathetic!

                    (furious)

               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

               Rapunzel, right?  School would

               probably fucking shut down if you

               didn't show up!  ""Queenie isn't

               here!""  I like those earrings Claire.



                            CLAIRE

                    (quietly)

               Shut up...



                            BENDER

               Are those real diamonds, Claire?



                            CLAIRE

                    (angry)

               Shut up!



                    BENDER                       CLAIRE

          I bet they are...did you

          work, for the money               Shut...

          for those earrings?                   Your mouth!



                            BENDER

               Or did your daddy buy those?



                            CLAIRE

                    (furious)

               Shut up!



     Claire starts crying.



                            BENDER

               I bet he bought those for you!  I

               bet those are a Christmas gift!

               Right?  You know what I got for

               Christmas this year?  It was a

               banner fuckin' year at the old

               Bender family!  I got a carton of

               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

               and said ""Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!""

               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

               daddy, don't cry here, okay?



     There are a few beats.



                            ANDREW

               My God, are we gonna be like our

               parents?



                            CLAIRE

               Not me...ever...



                           ALLISON

               It's unavoidable, it just happens.



                            CLAIRE

               What happens?



                           ALLISON

               When you grow up, your heart dies.



                            BENDER

               Who cares?



     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.



                           ALLISON

               I care...



                            BRIAN

               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

               know it's kind of a weird time, but

               I was just wondering, um, what is

               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

               we're all together again?  I mean I

               consider you guys my friends, I'm

               not wrong, am I?



                            ANDREW

               No...



                            BRIAN

               So, so on Monday...what happens?



                            CLAIRE

               Are we still friends, you mean?

               If we're friends now, that is?



                            BRIAN

               Yeah...



                            CLAIRE

               Do you want the truth?



                            BRIAN

               Yeah, I want the truth...



                            CLAIRE

               I don't think so...



                           ALLISON

               Well, do you mean all of us or just

               John?



                            CLAIRE

               With all of you...



                            ANDREW

               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!



                            CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do?  I mean

               picture this, you're there with all

               the sports.  I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him!



                            ANDREW

               No way!



                           ALLISON

               'Kay, what if I came up to you?



                            CLAIRE

               Same exact thing!



                            BENDER

                    (furious and screaming at Claire)

               You are a bitch!



                            CLAIRE

               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

               that makes me a bitch?



                            BENDER

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

               is to do to someone!  And you don't

               got the balls to stand up to your

               friends and tell 'em that you're

               gonna like who you wanna like!



                            CLAIRE

               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

               take Brian out to the parking lot at

               lunch to get high?  What about Andy

               for that matter, what about me?

               What would your friends say if we

               were walking down the hall together.

               They'd laugh their asses off and

               you'd probably tell them you were

               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               you for being seen with me.



                            BENDER

                    (furious once again)

               Don't you ever talk about my

               friends!  You don't know any of my

               friends, you don't look at any of my

               friends and you certainly wouldn't

               condescend to speak to any of my

               friends so you just stick to the

               things you know, shopping, nail

               polish, your father's BMW and your

               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

               Carribean!



                            CLAIRE

                    (furious and sobbing)

               Shut up!



                            BENDER

               And as far as being concerned about

               what's gonna happen when you and I

               walk down the hallways at school,

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

               gonna happen!  Just bury your head

               in the sand...and wait for your

               fuckin' prom!



                            CLAIRE

               I hate you!



                            BENDER

               Yeah?  Good!



     There is silence until Brian speaks.



                            BRIAN

               Then I assume Allison and I are

               better people than you guys, huh?

               Us weirdos...

                    (to Allison)

               Do you, would you do that to me?



                           ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                            BRIAN

               Well if you did?



                           ALLISON

               No...I don't think the kind of

               friends I'd have would mind...



                            BRIAN

               I just wanna tell, each of you,

               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

               real shitty...



                            CLAIRE

               Your friends wouldn't mind because

               they look up to us...



     Brian laughs at her.



                            BRIAN

               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               so conceited.  You're so, like, full

               of yourself, why are you like that?



                            CLAIRE

                    (crying again)

               I'm not saying that to be conceited!

               I hate it!  I hate having to go

               along with everything my friends say!



                            BRIAN

               Well then why do you do it?



                            CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't.  You're not

               friends with the same kind of people

               that Andy and I are friends with!

               You know, you just don't understand

               the pressure that they can put on

               you!



     Brian is shocked.



                            BRIAN

               I don't understand what?  You think

               I don't understand pressure, Claire?

               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!



     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.



                            BRIAN

               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

               gun in the locker...



                            ANDREW

               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?



                            BRIAN

               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...



                            ANDREW

               What's the gun for Brian?



                            BRIAN

               Just forget it...



                            ANDREW

               You brought it up, man!



                            BRIAN

               I can't have an F, I can't have it

               and I know my parents can't have it!

               Even if I aced the rest of the

               semester, I'm still only a B.  And

               everything's ruined for me!



                            CLAIRE

                    (with pity)

               Oh Brian...



     Brian bashes a chair over.



                            BRIAN

               So I considered my options, you

               know?



                            CLAIRE

               No!  Killing yourself is not an

               option!



                            BRIAN

               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

               don't think so!



                           ALLISON

               It was a hand gun?



                            BRIAN

               No, it was a flare gun, went off

               in my locker.



                            ANDREW

               Really?



     Andrew starts to laugh.



                            BRIAN

               It's not funny...



     They all start to laugh, including Brian.



                            BRIAN

               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

               destroyed!



                           ALLISON

               You wanna know what I did to get in

               here?  Nothing...I didn't have

               anything better to do.



     Everyone laughs.



                           ALLISON

               You're laughing at me...



                            ANDREW

               No!



     Allison starts to laugh too.



                           ALLISON

               Yeah you are!

                                                  CUT TO:","On March 24, 1984, five students — ""criminal"" John Bender, ""athlete"" Andrew Clark, ""brain"" Brian Johnson, ""basket case"" Allison Reynolds, and ""princess"" Claire Standish — report for Saturday morning detention at Shermer High School in the Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois.
While not complete strangers, each of them comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common.
They gather in the high school library where they are instructed by the assistant principal, Richard Vernon, not to speak, move from their seats, or sleep for a period of eight hours, fifty-four minutes (from 7:06 AM to 4 PM).
He assigns a 1,000-word essay to the students in which each must write about who he or she is.
He then leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them.
Bender, who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon, disregards the rules and constantly riles the other students, mocking Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire.
Allison is initially quiet except for the occasional random outburst.

The students pass the hours by arguing and smoking marijuana that Bender retrieves from his locker.
Gradually, they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar, Andrew hates his father, John comes from an abusive household, Brian has contemplated suicide, and Claire is a virgin.
They discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents and are afraid of making the same mistakes as the adults around them.
However, despite these developing friendships, the students are afraid that once the detention is over, they will return to their very different cliques and never speak to each other again.

Towards the end of the day, the other students ask Brian to write the essay that Vernon assigned earlier.
Brian does so, but instead of writing about the assigned topic, he writes a letter objecting to Vernon's request to describe who they are, stating that the man has already judged who they are (an athlete, basket case, princess, brain, and criminal), and that he will not accept any different accounts from them.
Brian signs the essay as ""The Breakfast Club"" and leaves it at the table for Vernon to read after they leave.
Before the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John.","LIBRARY - DAY 32



     They are sitting on the floor in a circle. ANDREW

               What would I do for a million bucks? Like, uh,

               private life with total strangers. ALLISON

               you're a prude. BENDER

                    (to Andrew)

               got you to admit something you didn't

               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

               any less bizarre...

               pretty bizarre! CLAIRE

               How are you bizarre? And I

               started thinking about my father,

               and his attitude about weakness. It

               take shop? I can

               also eat, brush my teeth...

               Shut up! CLAIRE

               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

               walking up to you in the hall on

               Monday, what would you do? I know exactly what

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

               when he left you'd cut him all up

               so your friends wouldn't think you

               really liked him! ALLISON

               I don't have any friends...



                            BRIAN

               Well if you did? CLAIRE

               I don't know, I don't...you don't

               understand..you don't. Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying. You pull the fuckin' trunk

               on it and the light's s'posed to go

               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

               I...

While not complete strangers, each of them comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common.
They gather in the high school library where they are instructed by the assistant principal, Richard Vernon, not to speak, move from their seats, or sleep for a period of eight hours, fifty-four minutes (from 7:06 AM to 4 PM).
He assigns a 1,000-word essay to the students in which each must write about who he or she is.
He then leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them.
Bender, who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon, disregards the rules and constantly riles the other students, mocking Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire.
Allison is initially quiet except for the occasional random outburst.

The students pass the hours by arguing and smoking marijuana that Bender retrieves from his locker.
Gradually, they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar, Andrew hates his father, John comes from an abusive household, Brian has contemplated suicide, and Claire is a virgin.
They discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents and are afraid of making the same mistakes as the adults around them.
However, despite these developing friendships, the students are afraid that once the detention is over, they will return to their very different cliques and never speak to each other again.

Towards the end of the day, the other students ask Brian to write the essay that Vernon assigned earlier.
Brian does so, but instead of writing about the assigned topic, he writes a letter objecting to Vernon's request to describe who they are, stating that the man has already judged who they are (an athlete, basket case, princess, brain, and criminal), and that he will not accept any different accounts from them.
Brian signs the essay as ""The Breakfast Club"" and leaves it at the table for Vernon to read after they leave.
Before the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John.","38. INT. HALLWAY - DAY 40
